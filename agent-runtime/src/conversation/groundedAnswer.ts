/**
 * <b>What a model-written sentence must look like before a seller reads it.</b>
 *
 * Grounded Conversation Lane v1 §3. This lane is the first place in the conversation runtime where the
 * sentence a seller reads is written by a model rather than composed from tokens, so it is the first
 * place that needs the check every other model seam already has in its own shape: the report narrative
 * refuses a claim with no fact id, the draft refuses a forbidden phrase, and this refuses prose that is
 * not seller-facing.
 *
 * <b>Refusal costs the older answer, never the turn.</b> Every rejection here falls back to the
 * deterministic composer — the one that shipped before this package — so the failure direction is
 * «narrower», exactly as an unavailable capability is.
 *
 * <b>It checks SHAPE, not truth.</b> Whether a sentence is true is what the fact sheet is for; a guard
 * that tried to verify claims would be a second model. What is checkable is whether our internal words
 * leaked, whether the answer is document-shaped, and whether it is long enough to be a repeat of the
 * card this package removed.
