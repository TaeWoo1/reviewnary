/**
 * Reviewnary Agentic Operating Workspace v2 — the CONVERSATION wire contract.
 *
 * <p>This is the one surface the frontend's conversation UI calls. It sits BESIDE the run contract
 * (`http/contract.ts`), not on top of it: a run is one investigation, a conversation is the seller's
 * working relationship with the AI operator across many turns — it remembers what was looked at, what
 * was filtered, what is waiting on a human, and what was prepared.
 *
 * <p><b>Three rules this file exists to hold.</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Artifacts are a closed vocabulary.</b> The model never names a component; the runtime
 *       composes one of the {@link ArtifactType}s below from tool evidence, and a result that fits no
 *       dedicated artifact is a {@code LIST} / {@code TABLE} / {@code SUMMARY}. Adding a type here is a
 *       product decision, never a per-request one.</li>
 *   <li><b>Identity + bounded context, never a second copy of the customer.</b> The persisted form of a
 *       turn keeps ids, closed-vocabulary labels, counts and dates. Fields marked <i>transient</i>
 *       (a review preview, an inquiry title, a draft body) are present on the live response and
 *       STRIPPED by {@code persistable()} before the conversation is stored — a reload re-reads them
 *       from the surface that owns them.</li>
 *   <li><b>Nothing here sends.</b> {@code HUMAN_ACTION_REQUIRED} asks the seller for one step;
 *       {@code APPROVAL} names the exact draft version a Human Approval would bind to; execution and
 *       verification remain the backend Action Executor's, reached only through the existing
 *       inquiry approval path. The runtime's tool catalogue is still 100% READ.</li>
 * </ol>
