/**
 * The conversation — the seller's working relationship with the AI operator across turns.
 *
 * <b>One turn = one Operator run, planned by the LLM planner or FAILED.</b> This service adds no
 * interpretation of its own: it loads the conversation, hands the planner what the previous turn put
 * in front of the seller (closed tokens only — `직전 작업 집합: REVIEWS (기간:TODAY, …)`), runs the
 * graph, and turns the answer into a {@code TurnView}. Whether a sentence is a filter over the last
 * set, a cross-domain follow-up, a draft request or a fresh question is the PLAN's decision
 * (`requestedAction`, `filters.scope`, `target`); the service reads those tokens and acts on them.
 *
 * <b>What it may do beyond reading, and where each stops.</b>
 *  · PREPARE a reply draft through the product's own draft path (`DraftPreparer`) — on the seller's
 *    sentence, for a target the previous turn showed; an append-only version, nothing sent. Inquiry
 *    drafts through the generate endpoint; review drafts through the review reply seam.
 *  · REFRESH a channel whose rows are stale and whose acquisition is the product's own API
 *    (`Refresher`) — one bounded collection the seller authorised by connecting, reported honestly.
 *  · ROUTE a send request to the path the channel and the object actually have: name the exact draft
 *    an approval would bind to (`APPROVAL`), name the guided seller-center step (`GUIDED_EXECUTION`),
 *    or say why neither exists (`SUMMARY`) — and stop. The confirm press, the Action Executor, the
 *    guided submission run and verification are the screens'; nothing here reaches them
 *    (`conversationWriteFence.test.ts`).
 *  · Ask for the seller's step(s) (`HUMAN_ACTION_REQUIRED`, one per channel) and wait; a later turn
 *    checks each step's own record (`GET /api/sync-runs`) before re-running the original request.
 *
 * <b>The message is deterministic prose over artifacts and SUPPORTED findings.</b> No sentence in a
 * turn is model-written; a model plans and judges, SellerOps composes.
