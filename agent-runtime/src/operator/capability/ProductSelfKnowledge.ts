/**
 * <b>What reviewnary itself is — as facts this deployment can prove, not a brochure.</b>
 *
 * <b>The defect this closes.</b> Measured live on a clean seller (2026-09-07). Three sentences, one
 * conversation:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>「지원하는 이커머스 종류가 뭐가 있지?」 → 「어느 채널에 대한 질문인지 알려주세요 (네이버 · 쿠팡 ·
 *       카페24)」 — a question about which channels exist, answered by asking the seller to name one,
 *       with the answer inside the parenthesis of the refusal.</li>
 *   <li>「연동하고 나면 어떻게 가능한거지?」 → the four-domain card.</li>
 *   <li>「연동하고 나면 뭐가 되냐고」 → 「판매 채널을 연결하는 것부터 하시면 됩니다」.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>The trace says it is not the planner.</b> All six sentences of the QA set plan as
 * `EXPLAIN_CAPABILITY` and the planner reads them correctly. What it could not do is say WHICH
 * capability question this is — the axis did not exist — so four of the six arrived with
 * `informationNeeds: []`, and the runtime's proxy for 「이건 우리 자신에 대한 질문이다」 was exactly
 * `informationNeeds.length === 0`. Under that proxy every distinct question about the product
 * collapses onto two fixed answers (the card, then the getting-started card), and a question that the
 * planner had annotated with a need was pushed into the CHANNEL lane and answered with a question.
 *
 * <b>What this file is.</b> The one factual source for questions whose subject is the product. Its
 * inputs are the sources of truth that already exist, and it duplicates none of them:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>what work it does ⇒ {@link capabilityDomains} over the REGISTERED tool catalogue;</li>
 *   <li>the write boundary ⇒ {@link boundarySentence} over the catalogue's own action classes;</li>
 *   <li>which channels, and what each offers ⇒ the turn's `GET /api/channels/coverage` snapshot that
 *       {@link WorldState} already carries — zero extra reads;</li>
 *   <li>what a channel can actually DO ⇒ the same pure resolver every execution path uses
 *       ({@link capabilityOf}) over the same backend reads, which are CHANNEL-keyed and therefore
 *       answerable before anything is connected;</li>
 *   <li>the daily loop ⇒ the {@link ProcedureId} records, named by the procedures that exist.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>What it must never become.</b> A written-down feature list, or a reply keyed to an example
 * sentence. Nothing here reads the seller's words: which aspect is being asked is
 * {@link PlanFilters.capabilityAspect}, a closed token the LLM planner fills, and this file turns that
 * token plus real reads into sentences. Add a channel to the coverage table and the answer gains it;
 * turn a capability off in the deployment and the answer loses it, in the same breath as the execution
 * path that would have refused.
 *
 * <b>NO_CHANNEL is about the seller's data, not about us.</b> A shop with nothing connected can still
 * be told what this product is, which channels it supports and what each one will do once connected —
 * every fact above is a fact about the deployment. Only the sentences that describe THIS shop's rows
 * are withheld, and they are the ones {@link SellerReadiness} already gates.
