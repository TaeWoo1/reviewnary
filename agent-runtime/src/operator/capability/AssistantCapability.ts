/**
 * What reviewnary can do — derived from what it is actually wired to do, said for the state this
 * seller is actually in.
 *
 * <b>The defect this closes (v1).</b> 「너는 어떤 일을 도와줄 수 있어?」 was planned as `EXPLAIN_CAPABILITY`,
 * which existed for exactly one shape of question — 「쿠팡 건은 왜 답변 못 해?」, a CHANNEL's capability —
 * so a question about the assistant itself came back as 「어느 채널에 대한 질문인지 알려주세요」 beside a
 * quote of the seller's own 배송 기준 (measured live, 2026-09-01). The action was right; it had one
 * answer and the question had another.
 *
 * <b>The defect this closes (v2, first-use).</b> Measured live on a clean org (2026-09-05), two
 * different questions one turn apart — 「이 서비스를 통해 할 수 있는 일이 뭐야?」 and 「아직 쇼핑몰을
 * 연결하지 않았는데 어떻게 시작해?」 — came back with the SAME eight-line brochure. The trace says why and
 * it is not history, not a fallback and not the planner misreading: both plans were
 * `EXPLAIN_CAPABILITY` with `informationNeeds: 0`, and the one answer this file composed was a pure
 * function of the tool catalogue plus a coverage read — it took no input from the seller's sentence and
 * no input from what the conversation had already said, so identical inputs produced an identical
 * answer. Two things follow, and both are structural rather than a wording exception:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The answer is shaped by readiness.</b> A seller with nothing connected is told what
 *       connecting hands over and given the one action that exists; the chips stop being 「답변 안 한
 *       문의 보여줘」, which that seller cannot ask.</li>
 *   <li><b>A fact is said once</b> (the rule this repository already applies to titles, shared words and
 *       collection state). The capability card is drawn once; asking again is answered with the next
 *       step instead of the same list. <b>Narrowed on 2026-09-07</b> — see the closing note: keyed per
 *       conversation, this rule made every later product question return one fixed answer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Derived, not written down.</b> A domain is said only when a REGISTERED tool serves it
 * ({@link TOOL_CAPABILITIES} ∩ the catalogue the runtime builds), the boundary sentence is chosen from
 * the catalogue's own action classes, and the channels named in the getting-started answer come from the
 * coverage table rather than a list in this file. Add a tool with a caller and the answer gains its
 * domain; a catalogue that ever held a WRITE tool could not keep saying the read-only sentence — and it
 * cannot hold one, because {@link OperatorToolRegistry} refuses to construct with it. The seller-facing
 * WORDS are ours, as every seller sentence in this runtime is (`wording/sellerWording.ts`); what is
 * derived is which of them are true today.
 *
 * <b>What it must never become.</b> A hand-maintained feature list, or a canned reply keyed to an
 * example sentence. Both were available and both are the thing that goes stale the first time the
 * product changes. Nothing here reads the seller's words.
 *
 * <b>Where the sentences went (2026-09-07).</b> This file is now the DERIVATION only — which domains
 * are real, and what the boundary is. The answers themselves live in
 * {@link ../capability/ProductSelfKnowledge}, because 「뭘 할 수 있어?」 turned out to be one of five
 * different product questions and this file could only ever answer it as one. Keeping a second copy of
 * 「연결부터 하시면 됩니다」 here would be the same defect the split closes.
