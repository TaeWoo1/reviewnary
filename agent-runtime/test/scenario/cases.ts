/**
 * <b>The scenario eval's conversations, as data.</b>
 *
 * Planner Model & Prompt Benchmark v1 §2. Until this file the conversations lived inside the three
 * `*.scenario.test.ts` files, which meant they could only ever be run one way — replayed from
 * {@code SCENARIO_PLANS}, which is exactly right for CI and useless for measuring a planner. A
 * benchmark that restated them somewhere else would be grading a second copy that drifts.
 *
 * So the cases are stated once here and consumed twice: the test files run them against recorded
 * plans (CI calls no vendor), and {@code bench/} runs the same turns with the plan coming live from
 * whichever model an arm names. <b>The expectations do not change between the two</b> — that is the
 * whole point. A model is scored by whether the product's own assertions hold.
 *
 * Nothing about the format moved; see {@link ./scenario.ts} for `world`, `never` and the runner.
