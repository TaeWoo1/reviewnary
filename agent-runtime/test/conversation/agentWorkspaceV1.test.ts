/**
 * Frontend-first Agent Workspace Redesign v1 — the runtime half.
 *
 * Two contracts, and both of them are about what the seller is STANDING ON:
 *
 * §A <b>A product and a review can be the current object.</b> The focus contract named inquiries only,
 *    so a product row was the one list that dead-ended: nothing to press, nothing to say 「이 상품」
 *    about. Now the same transition serves all three, one anchor at a time, verified by what can
 *    actually prove each kind.
 * §B <b>A question about the assistant is answered by the assistant.</b> Measured live before this
 *    existed: 「너는 어떤 일을 도와줄 수 있어?」 came back as 「어느 채널에 대한 질문인지 알려주세요」 beside a
 *    quote of the seller's own 배송 기준. The action was right — `EXPLAIN_CAPABILITY` — and it had only
 *    ever learned to talk about a channel.
 *
 * Every assertion reads state or counts reads. None reads a sentence a model wrote, because none of
 * these sentences is written by one.
