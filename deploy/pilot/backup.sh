# Daily logical backup — Pilot Host Provisioning v1 §4/§11, off-host copy per Pilot Provisioning
# Plan v1 §3 (blocker B5).
#   deploy/pilot/backup.sh            # writes /var/backups/sellerops/sellerops-YYYYmmdd-HHMM.dump (pg_dump -Fc)
#                                     # then, when SELLEROPS_BACKUP_S3_ENABLED=true, uploads it off-host
#   deploy/pilot/backup.sh --local-only   # the dump only; never touches object storage
#
# `--local-only` exists for exactly one caller: deploy.sh's pre-migration dump. What that dump is FOR
# is the rollback of the migration about to run, and that rollback is performed from this host — so
# making a deploy depend on object storage being reachable would block an urgent fix for a reason
# that has nothing to do with the deploy. The DAILY cron run is the one that owes both halves, and it
# is the one whose exit status says so.
# Install:  deploy/pilot/install-backup-job.sh
#           It writes a systemd service + timer (sellerops-backup.{service,timer}) and enables them.
#           NOT a cron line: the schedule must be 03:17 **Asia/Seoul** on a host whose own timezone
#           this repository does not set, and Ubuntu 24.04's default cron cannot be relied on for
#           per-job timezone scheduling — it parses, it runs, and it runs at the wrong hour. systemd
#           puts the zone in the calendar (`OnCalendar=*-*-* 03:17:00 Asia/Seoul`) and validates it
#           before install. The unit also carries PATH (AWS CLI v2's shim is in /usr/local/bin, which
#           a service's minimal environment does not have) and TZ=Asia/Seoul, which is what makes the
#           `date` below name the dump for the hour it actually ran at.
#
# The dump contains sealed credentials (vault ciphertext) and seller data: the directory is 0700 root.
# It contains NO env secret — the vault master key and JWT secret live only in /etc/sellerops/pilot.env,
# which is deliberately NOT part of the backup.
#
# THAT IS WHY THE KEY HAS ITS OWN CUSTODY. A dump restored under a different master key opens nothing,
# so an off-host copy of the dump is only half of "recoverable after losing the host": the other half
# is an off-host copy of SELLEROPS_VAULT_MASTER_KEY, kept somewhere OTHER than this bucket, by the
# operator. Nothing in this script can check that, so it is said here and asserted by rehearsal
# (Pilot Provisioning Plan v1 §6-B, B5-6/B5-7).
#
# Retention is split on purpose:
#   * local   — this script prunes, because it wrote them (PILOT_BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS).
#   * off-host — THE BUCKET'S LIFECYCLE POLICY prunes, and this script never deletes a remote object.
#     A script that knows how to delete is a script that can delete, and the uploader's credential is
#     deliberately PutObject-only so that a compromised host cannot erase its own history.

# ── which credential, and the one state that is not a choice ─────────────────────────────────────

#                reading a file. That is why blank is a supported posture and not an oversight.
#   one of two — refused. It is not a posture: it is a half-finished edit of one of the other two,
#                and the failure it would otherwise produce is a SigV4 error at 03:17.

# `s3api put-object` is ONE PutObject call. This is not a stylistic choice over `s3 cp`:

# The PutObject response IS the receipt: with a PutObject-only credential we cannot read the object
