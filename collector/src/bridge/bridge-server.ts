/**
 * **Local Agent Bridge server (loopback transport shell).** Wraps the pure pairing/event/origin security
 * core in a minimal `node:http` server that listens ONLY on loopback and speaks the bridge protocol (slice
 * §0, §5, §11). The WebSocket transport is the mature **`ws`** library (no hand-rolled RFC6455 framing):
 * `ws` handles the handshake, framing, protocol ping/pong replies, close frames, malformed clients, and
 * TCP-level disconnects, with an explicit `maxPayload` cap and compression disabled. Binary payloads are
 * rejected — G1 is JSON text only. `ws` does NOT proactively probe liveness, so a server-side heartbeat
 * (see {@link BridgeServer.beat}) pings each status socket and reaps half-open peers that vanished without
 * a close frame (laptop sleep, network drop with no FIN) — otherwise they would linger in `clients` and be
 * broadcast to forever, and `liveClientCount` would over-report.
 *
 * The security decisions stay OURS and run BEFORE `ws` ever sees the socket: loopback-only bind, explicit
 * origin allow (never wildcard), single-use ticket consume with replay protection, and an unauthenticated
 * health surface that carries no pairing/connection detail. G1 is pairing + observability only — there are
 * NO marketplace-workflow / browser-control / click / credential commands.
