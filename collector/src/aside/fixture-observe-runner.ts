/**
 * **The helper's side of the unattended lane: ask if there is work, do exactly that work, report a token.**
 *
 * This is the only loop in this product that acts with nobody watching, so what it CANNOT do is the design:
 *
 *  - it cannot be told where to go. The backend hands back a recipe NAME, never a URL. Each name is resolved
 *    HERE to a route this build published — the loopback fixture through `validateFixtureObserveWorkflow`, the
 *    Coupang 리뷰 목록 through the product's own WING classifier — and a name this build does not publish is
 *    refused without running anything. There is no field in either direction through which a third target
 *    could be expressed.
 *  - it cannot be told what to do. There is no prompt, script or step list on the wire — each program is built
 *    from a frozen recipe, and `aside-guard.test.ts` holds every file here to the same closed vocabulary.
 *  - it cannot report prose. The outcome is one of four closed tokens plus a count and a digest. No page text
 *    ever leaves this machine.
 *  - it cannot invent an empty surface. A run that could not read returns a failure token, never `OBSERVED 0` —
 *    the distinction the whole scheduled proof rests on, and the reason a signed-out marketplace reports
 *    absence rather than a store with no reviews.
