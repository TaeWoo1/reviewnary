/**
 * **The helper's side of the unattended NAVER Seller Center 리뷰 read: read the screen's period, hand the rows to
 * the backend for the job this helper holds, report a closed token.**
 *
 * The loopback runner (`fixture-observe-runner.ts`) states what an unattended loop must not be able to do, and this
 * file inherits all of it:
 *
 *  - **it cannot be told where to go.** The recipe NAME resolves here to `NAVER_REVIEW_READ_WORKFLOW`, whose one
 *    route is screened by parsing before a tab opens. No field on the wire can name another.
 *  - **it cannot be told what to do.** No prompt, script or step list is on the wire. The program is built here
 *    from the frozen runtime and this repository's own page scripts: no click, no keystroke, no download, no reply.
 *  - **it cannot prove its own store.** The store is judged by the backend at delivery, against the organisation's
 *    own catalogue. The helper is never handed what it would be compared with.
 *  - **it cannot invent an empty store.** A signed-out browser, a page that did not settle, a period that is not
 *    current, a row this file does not understand, or a delivery that did not land all report a failure token with
 *    no count. The count it does report is the rows it read AND the backend accepted.
 *
 * **Coverage is stated, not assumed.** The range census (live-proven on the reply lane) reduces the screen's period
 * to day offsets. The read is accepted only when the period ends today and every row sits inside it; the period's
 * length travels to the backend as the bound this read covered.
