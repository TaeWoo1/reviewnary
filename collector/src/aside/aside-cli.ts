/**
 * **The one way this package talks to Aside: `aside repl <program>`.**
 *
 * Aside (`docs/aside_capability_discovery_v1.md`) exposes two ways to drive its browser — `exec`, which hands a
 * prompt to an LLM agent, and `repl`, which runs Playwright-style JavaScript deterministically with no model
 * call. Reviewnary uses `repl` and nothing else. That is not a preference recorded in a comment; it is the
 * shape of this module: {@link ASIDE_ALLOWED_INVOCATIONS} is the closed list of argv heads this wrapper will
 * ever spawn, and `aside-guard.test.ts` reads the source to make sure no other literal exists.
 *
 * ## Result protocol
 *
 * A program prints exactly one line `ASIDE_RESULT <json>` on stdout when it has an answer. Everything else on
 * stdout (Aside's own "opened a tab (url)" line, timing badges) is noise and is never returned or logged — a
 * tab line contains the URL. Aside exits 0 even when the program throws (observed 2026-09-12: the error goes to
 * stderr, exit code stays 0), so the exit code carries no signal; the presence of the result line does.
 *
 * ## What comes out
 *
 * Only the parsed result or a closed classification. Never stdout text, never stderr text, never the program.
