 *
 * <b>초안 준비됨 is a draft, not a phase.</b> It used to be read off the work item's lifecycle phase
 * (`PROPOSED`), which is written when a PROPOSAL is recorded — and an `InquiryProposal` stores no
 * reply text at all, by its own contract. On 2026-09-04 the demo org held ten such rows and eight of
 * them had no draft: the list was telling the seller to go read something nobody had written. It now
 * reads `hasDraft`, the fact the queue reports. A `PROPOSED` row with no draft is simply what it
 * always was — an inquiry the customer has not been answered.
