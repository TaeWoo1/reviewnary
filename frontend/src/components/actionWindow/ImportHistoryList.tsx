/**
 * 최근 가져오기 기록 — the seller's own record of what their review imports brought.
 *
 * Self-fetching and **fail-closed**, the same rule the attention reads follow: a dead backend renders
 * an error, never the calm empty state. The two are different facts and must never be confused —
 * "아직 가져온 기록이 없어요" says the seller has never imported, and saying that when the read simply
 * failed would be a reassuring lie.
 *
 * **Recent, and it says so.** The endpoint is bounded (newest N), so the heading claims recency rather
 * than completeness — this is not an archive and must not read as one.
 *
 * **Scoped, and it says that too.** The read selects file uploads and seller-center exports. Reviews
 * that arrive by API collection (a `dataType=REVIEW` sync run) are a different acquisition path and do
 * NOT appear here, so the sub-heading names the two paths it covers rather than claiming to be every
 * review the seller has ever collected.
 *
 * Persistence is the point. Until now the home's activity rail lived in browser memory: it started
 * empty and vanished on reload, so yesterday's import left no trace anywhere the seller looks. This
 * reads the imports the backend has been recording all along.
 *
 * Copy is FE-owned (`lib/importHistory.ts`); the server sends counts, a status and a provenance, and
 * never an error message — a failure is explained here, not quoted from the backend.
