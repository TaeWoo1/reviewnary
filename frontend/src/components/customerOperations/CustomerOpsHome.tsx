 * How many rows the list shows before 「+N」.

 *
 * <p><b>Then the Pulse took the room seven depended on</b> (product-owner decision, 2026-09-26). Measured at
 * 1152×720: the list's own scroller ends at y=631 and seven rows used to end at 585 — 46px of slack. The Pulse
 * and its heading are 118px where the line they replaced was 21px, so the first row now starts at y=246 instead
 * of 145 and a seventh row would end at 687 — <b>56px past the bottom of the scroller that holds it</b>. Seven
 * and the Pulse are not both true there, so the narrow case shows six, ending at 624 with 7px to spare.
 * <b>A row is either whole or absent</b>: the alternative was leaving the seventh clipped, and a row you can
 * read the top of is a row the screen is pretending to show. At 1440×900 nothing changed — seven rows end at
 * 688 with 151px of clearance to the composer. The numbers above are re-measured against the band as shipped,
 * not against the first cut of it.
 *
 * <p>The constant below still means what it meant — the capacity of the widest case, and the number every
 * other surface reasons about. What is new is that the <i>visible</i> limit is its own named function of the
 * layout, not a second constant and not a measurement: {@link visibleHomeRows}. It reuses the side preview's
 * 1200 breakpoint rather than inventing one, because that is the width at which this column stops being the
 * whole page, and a row count that disagrees with the layout it sits in is the bug this replaces.

 * gives twice. The three columns hold three different windows: 오늘 들어온 것 is a KST day, 확인할 일 is now,
 * 최근 24시간 is a rolling window on cases we opened. A heading that says 오늘 puts one window over all three
 * and makes the third one read as today's — which is the exact move `homeSummary.recentDay` refuses when it
 * keeps `monitoring`/`verifying` out of a windowed group. 운영 is the noun that is true of all three, and it
 * carries no window at all. It also stops the page from saying 오늘 twice in 60px; the tie to the title is
 * the heading's position under it, not a repeated word. <b>Flipping it back is one string</b> if the product
 * owner would rather have the repetition than the neutral noun.
 *
 * <p>It is the surface's accessible name too (`aria-labelledby`), not a second string beside a visual one:
 * a surface with a visible heading and a different `aria-label` has two names, and only one of them is
 * the one people quote to each other.

/**
 * <b>Operational Pulse — 오늘 들어온 것 · 확인할 일 · 최근 24시간</b>, one surface above the inbox.
 *
 * <p>The data contract is `docs/pilot_usage_loop_v1.md` §8 and it does not move here: <b>no new read</b>
 * (every value comes from the five the Home already makes), no KPI card, no tile, no chart.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it stopped being a line</b> (product-owner decision, 2026-09-26). Measured, the 13px muted
 * line was the status line's second row — same font-size, same colour, same line-height, 4px under it —
 * so a seller read it as more date metadata and the screen answered 「오늘 운영이 어떻게 흐르고 있나」 in
 * the type of a caption.
 *
 * <p><b>And why the promotion was then re-cut</b> (product-owner decision, same day, from the rendered
 * screen). Four things were measured wrong on the first cut and all four have the same cause — <b>only a
 * number was treated as a value</b>. At 1440 the surface was 1,144px wide and carried 307px of ink: three
 * items at a 344px pitch, which is a row of three unrelated things, not one overview. The middle cell was a
 * bare 「11」 at 22px beside two cells whose value line was 13px text, so the screen had exactly one figure
 * and it read as a lone KPI. 「수집 상태 확인 필요」 and 「새로 확인한 일 없음」 sat in a 29px line box at
 * caption size — the two states a seller most needs to see at a glance were the quietest text in the band.
 *
 * <p>So the rule here is now one rule: <b>every cell has the same three tiers — 질문 / 지금 상태 / 그 상태를
 * 한정하는 사실 — and the middle tier is one type size whatever it holds.</b> A count and a withheld count are
 * both answers to 「오늘 들어온 것」; a band that grows to 20px only when the answer is a number is a band that
 * shrinks precisely when the seller needs to notice something. What still separates them is <b>ink</b>: a
 * measured figure is ink and semibold, and every other word on that line — the unit nouns and the state
 * sentences — is the ordinary muted weight. No warn colour, no icon, no tint: 「아직 확인하지 못했다」 is a
 * smaller claim than the numbers beside it, and a band that turns orange when a channel is quiet trains a
 * seller to stop reading the band.
 *
 * <p><b>One surface, not three cards</b> — and the surface is now the width of what it holds (`max-w-3xl`)
 * rather than the width of the page. The columns are thirds of 768px, so the pitch is 240px against ~175px
 * of ink instead of 344px against 116px, and the two hairlines between them are the cheapest way to say
 * 「these three belong to one reading」. Zendesk's Agent Home statistics card does exactly this at exactly
 * this scale: a heading, a narrow container, even columns, and a hairline between each figure — and nobody
 * reads those three as three cards. No shadow, no gradient, no icon, no chart, and the cells themselves
 * carry no fill, border or radius of their own.
 *
 * <p><b>The three cells are not three counts of the same kind.</b> The first is a measured day, the second
 * is now, the third is a window on cases we opened — which is why each carries its own lead word instead of
 * one heading that would make a single window true of all three. Zendesk does this too, and for the same
 * reason: 「This week」 and 「60 days」 stand under each statistic's own name rather than over the group.
 *
 * <p>The second cell says <b>확인할 일</b> — the same canonical noun as the section heading below it,
 * because it is the same set counted once. A second name (「지금 확인할 것」) would have split one meaning
 * into two words twelve pixels apart, and the total now lives here alone: the list's way out says
 * 「전체 보기」 and names no number.
 *
 * <p>A cell with nothing true to say renders nothing, and when no cell has, neither does the surface.
 * That is not tidiness: an inflow read that failed, a job that is not running, and an org with no window
 * yet are three different silences, and none of them is 「0」.

 * <b>반복 문제 — what repeated, on which product, how often, and why it is worth a look.</b>
 *
 * <p>This used to be one grey line: 「관찰 중 {decidable + observing}」 plus, if any problem happened to have a trend
 * label, that one problem's title. Three things were wrong with it, and only the third is about layout.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It printed a sum under one of its parts' names.</b> {@code decidable} and {@code observing} are two
 *       populations the server returns separately and documents as un-addable; adding them and labelling the total
 *       「관찰 중」 told a seller with one problem 조치 중 and nineteen 관찰 중 that twenty were 관찰 중.</li>
 *   <li><b>Its link went to the list, not to the problem</b>, whenever no trend fired — which is the ordinary case
 *       for a problem that repeated steadily rather than suddenly.</li>
 *   <li><b>It named no product, no evidence and no count.</b> On the org this was measured against, eighteen pieces
 *       of evidence for one problem on one product rendered as 「관찰 중 20 · 보기」.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The rows were already on the wire — {@code ops.problems} is the Operations Home read AgentHome makes anyway,
 * already bounded to three, already ordered decidable-first by the server, already carrying each problem's
 * per-product evidence. Nothing new is read, derived or judged here; the same rows the other Home draws are drawn
 * here, by the same component.
 *
 * <p><b>Still not a task.</b> It sits below 「확인 필요」, has no verb and no button, and states its two counts as the
 * server's own sentence ({@code problemLine}) rather than as a workload. A repeated problem is a pattern over many
 * reviews, not another customer waiting — that separation is the reason one row can stand for eighteen of them
 * without the Home saying the same thing twice.
