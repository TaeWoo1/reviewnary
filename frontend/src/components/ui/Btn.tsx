 * `solid` is `bg-brand-700`, not `bg-brand`: white text on #3182F6 measures 3.71:1 and misses AA,
 * while #1B64DA measures 5.41:1. The accent is spent on actions and nowhere else, so this is the
 * only place the strong brand value appears in the app surface.
 *
 * <b>Hover darkens.</b> It used to lighten to `brand-600`, and white on #2272EB measures 4.49:1 —
 * under AA on the most-pressed control in the product, in the state the seller's cursor is in while
 * they read it. Measured in a real browser, composited, on 2026-08-27. `brand-800` is 7.38:1.

/**
 * <b>`selected` is a state, not an action</b> (Home v3).
 *
 * <p>A segmented control marking which option is currently recorded was using `solid`, so the strongest
 * value in the product — reserved above for «the thing this screen is for» — was being spent on
 * «this is the value you already chose». Measured on the Review Case pane at 1440×900: the filled
 * control at y=405 was a classification the seller had already made, while the action the pane exists
 * for sat at y=960, below the fold and no louder than a save button.
 *
 * <p>The treatment is not new. `bg-brand/10 text-brand-700` is what the disposition control beside it
 * already used for exactly this meaning, so the two segmented controls in one pane stop answering the
 * same question two ways.
 *
 * <p><b>And it carries a border</b> (product-owner decision, 2026-10-01: 상태 chip · 선택 button ·
 * navigation link must not look alike). A tint with no edge reads as a status chip — the same shape
 * `Status` draws for 초안 준비됨 — so the one control on the pane that RECORDS something looked like a
 * label reporting something. The border is what a segmented control has: every option in the group now
 * has the same box, and the chosen one differs by fill and ink alone. Against `solid` the distance is
 * unchanged and deliberate: an outlined tint is 「you chose this」, a filled accent is 「press this」.
