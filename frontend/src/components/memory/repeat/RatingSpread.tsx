/**
 * <b>어떤 별점에서 나왔나</b> — the star bands this problem was raised in, as counts.
 *
 * <b>Why a seller needs it.</b> A repeated problem spoken about entirely inside 4–5★ reviews is
 * invisible to every screen that sorts by rating, and it is a different kind of problem from one
 * that arrives with 1★ anger: nobody is complaining, and it still keeps happening. On this org
 * 접착 부족 is exactly that — 5★ 10건, 1–2★ 0건.
 *
 * <b>Counts only.</b> No share, no average, no ranking. The bar widths below are drawn relative to
 * the largest band and carry no number of their own; they are a reading aid for the counts beside
 * them, which is why every row also states its figure.
 *
 * <b>Two columns, and the bars are grey</b> (canonical, 2026-10-03). Six full-width rows were the
 * tallest thing in a pane that also has an evidence trend above it, and the bars were drawn in
 * `brand-700` — the same blue as the button that records a decision. One rule now: a bar is data and
 * takes `muted`; blue means something a seller can press.
