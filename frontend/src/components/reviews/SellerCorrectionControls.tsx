/**
 * The seller's own judgment for one review — T-07, and now on both surfaces that show a review.
 *
 * <b>Why it moved out of the record screen.</b> It was written as a local function inside
 * `ChannelReviews.tsx`, which made the record the only place a seller could disagree with the system.
 * The Decision Workspace asks the same question one step before the action choice — 「판매자님 판단은
 * 어떠신가요?」 is what the 조치 선택 stands on — so the control is one component with two callers
 * rather than two components that agree today.
 *
 * <b>Available whether or not the AI pilot is on.</b> The pilot decides what the SYSTEM says about a
 * review, not whether the seller may disagree with it.
 *
 * <b>Three choices, the same three words the chips use.</b> It was two, and 필요 없음 was stored as
 * whatever the rule would have said — so a seller who meant 참고 had 지켜보기 recorded under their name.
 *
 * <b>What this does: record.</b> It changes no tier, moves no row, hides nothing and trains nothing.
 * The copy says so once, because a seller who corrects a review and watches the list stay put deserves
 * to know that is the design.
