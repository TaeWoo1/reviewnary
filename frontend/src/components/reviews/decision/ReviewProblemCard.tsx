 * <b>What the problem is, and why it is in front of you</b> — the first two questions of the Decision

 * <b>The customer's sentence is the largest text on the page.</b> It was not, before: the reply task
 * screen opened on a draft and folded the customer away under 「이 리뷰의 자동 분류」, which is the
 * right fold for a screen whose only question is «approve this text» and the wrong one for a screen
 * whose question is «is this worth your hands». A seller cannot decide what to do about a complaint
 * they have to expand to read.
 *
 * <b>The tier and the reason are shown, not folded.</b> They are the answer to 「왜 확인해야 하는가」 —
 * the second question — and the one thing kept behind a fold is the keyword classification, whose
 * accuracy has never been measured and which the disclosure says so about.
 *
 * <b>Nothing here is composed by this component.</b> The reason sentence is the backend's
 * (`ReviewTriageNote`), the recommended action is null for 참고 and renders as nothing rather than as
 * a reassuring filler, and the body is the server's redacted full text.
