/**
 * <b>기록</b> — the eighth and last block: what has already been decided about this review.
 *
 * <b>No new table stands behind it.</b> Every line is read from a trail this product has been writing
 * for months and nobody was reading: the seller's corrections, the response decision, the explicit
 * acts, the reply approval, the reported outcome. That is why a refresh does not lose anything on this
 * screen — none of it ever lived in the browser.
 *
 * <b>Newest first.</b> The question the log answers HERE is «where does this stand», and the answer is
 * the last thing that happened. The trails themselves still read oldest-first where the history is the
 * subject rather than the footnote.
 *
 * <b>An entry this build cannot name is not drawn.</b> The server's vocabulary may grow ahead of the
 * screen, and a row rendered as its own raw token is exactly the internal-word leak this product
 * removes everywhere else.
 *
 * <b>Empty is a real state and says so.</b> A review nobody has decided has no history, and inventing
 * a 「판단 전」 event would put a decision in the trail that nobody made.
