/**
 * <b>이 상품에 대해 우리가 아는 것</b> — the fourth question: what would a reply stand on.
 *
 * <b>Counts and titles, never bodies.</b> This block answers «is there anything registered about
 * this», which is a question about the library. What a DRAFT actually stood on is a different
 * question with a different answer, and it is shown where it belongs — as the draft's own citations,
 * read back from the source at display time.
 *
 * <b>Nothing is retrieved to render this.</b> Running retrieval at open would spend a model round
 * trip per workspace open (Retrieval v2: a question rewrite and an eligibility judgement) for a
 * passage nobody has asked for yet, and it would make opening a review cost money. These are four
 * counts and up to five titles.
 *
 * <b>Only active sources are counted.</b> A retired document cannot ground anything, so counting it
 * would tell the seller they have knowledge the drafter cannot see.
 *
 * <b>확인 필요 is the honest half.</b> A seller looking at a thin draft is entitled to know that
 * reviewnary has already asked N questions about this product that nobody has answered — that is
 * usually the reason, and it is one click from being fixed.
