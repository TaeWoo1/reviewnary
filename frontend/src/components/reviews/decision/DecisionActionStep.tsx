/**
 * <b>조치 선택</b> — the sixth step, and the one the whole screen is arranged around.
 *
 * <b>It writes the decision the product already has.</b> `TriageDisposition`, through
 * `VocItemTriageControl`, through the endpoint that has owned the row lock, the idempotency key and
 * the append-only trail since it was built. This component adds a heading, a sentence and a place —
 * not a second decision store, and not a second set of words for the three values.
 *
 * <b>The address comes from the server, and it is not the reply's.</b> Until now the only ref a
 * review-shaped surface could get was `ChannelReviewDetailView.replyWork.actionRef`, which is null on
 * every channel with no reply flow — so on Coupang a seller could not record a decision at all, even
 * though the decision endpoint has never been capability-gated and `TriageDisposition` says in its own
 * contract that deciding is not replying. The workspace reads `decisionRef` from the decision context,
 * which is handed out for every review it can open.
 *
 * <b>완료 기록 offers two acts, not three.</b> 조치 불필요 exists in `TriageActionKind` and the pilot's
 * controls still write it on the record screen — but the step above already records exactly that
 * statement as `NO_ACTION`, in the decision spine, with its own trail. One press landing in two spines
 * at two evidential strengths is the thing the triage contract §5-C says must not happen.
 *
 * <b>Nothing here touches a marketplace.</b> 조치 시작 / 조치 완료 are the seller's statement about
 * something they did on their own side of the counter, stored as one.
