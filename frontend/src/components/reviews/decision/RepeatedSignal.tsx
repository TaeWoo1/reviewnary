/**
 * <b>반복 신호</b> — the third question: has anyone said this before, and who.
 *
 * <b>The similarity is the extractor's, not this screen's.</b> Every review listed here is one the
 * issue pipeline already recorded as evidence for the same problem this review backs. There is no
 * "looks alike" judgement anywhere in this component, and there must not be one: this repository has
 * exactly one similarity mechanism (the aspect+problem signature), and a second one invented for a
 * workspace would be an unmeasured classifier deciding what a seller reads first.
 *
 * <b>An empty list is a statement about our records.</b> 「아직 반복 문제의 근거로 기록되지 않았습니다」
 * — not 「반복된 적 없습니다」, which would be a claim about the world made from one table. A failed
 * read renders nothing at all, because a screen that could not see the issue memory has nothing to say
 * about it.
 *
 * <b>And it says which records.</b> The triage note a few centimetres above counts a different thing —
 * how many of this channel's reviews share one stored analysis category — and used to call that 반복
 * too, so this section's 「아직 …않았습니다」 read as a denial of the sentence directly above it. The
 * clause names the other mechanism instead of arguing with it; neither judgement moved.
 *
 * <b>No count is invented.</b> `evidenceCount` is org-wide and all-time, exactly as the 고객운영 메모리
 * list means it, and the per-problem 근거 전체 보기 link is where the whole set is measured.
