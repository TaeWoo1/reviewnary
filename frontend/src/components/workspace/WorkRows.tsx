/**
 * The rows of 확인할 일 — on 오늘 (the first few) and on the queue (all of them) — drawn once, here.
 *
 * <p><b>No row carries a button.</b> Every row used to end in 「검토」 — twenty-seven identical controls, the first one
 * solid, on a list whose rows were already links. A row is now a selection: on a wide screen it opens the item in the
 * pane beside the list, where the one primary action lives; on a narrow one it opens the item's own screen, exactly
 * as before.
 *
 * <p><b>A reason every row carries is not a reason to tell them apart</b> (`lib/sharedWord.ts`). Measured on the
 * real org at 1440×900, all five rows of 오늘 read 「리뷰」 in a badge and 「쿠팡 리뷰 ★1」 beside it — the word
 * twice on one line, five times down the list, on a screen whose content is what the customers wrote. When every
 * row shares the tag the rows drop the badge and the list says it once: on 오늘 the heading already does
 * ({@code reasonCounts}, with its count), which is what {@code captionSaysReason} means; anywhere else this list
 * prints the caption itself, so the word is never simply lost.
 *
 * <p><b>The wait leads the row</b>, because this list is ordered by it. It used to sit right-aligned at x=1327 —
 * 990px from the start of the sentence it qualifies — so the sort key was the last thing the eye reached. Nothing
 * else about the row moved and no ordering changed.
 *
 * <p><b>The two groups are drawn, not just sorted.</b> {@link isOldBacklog} has ordered this list inside two groups
 * since the Demo Core freeze; a year-plus backlog row still waited in the same unbroken list, at the same weight as
 * this month's. A divider now says where the old ones start. Nothing is hidden, folded or re-ordered.
