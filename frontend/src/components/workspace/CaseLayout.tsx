 * <b>CaseLayout — one shape for every screen where the seller decides one thing</b> (UI/UX v2 Phase 1).
 *
 * <p>Inquiry Case, Review Case and a repeated problem used to be three layouts with three orders: one opened on the
 * customer's sentence, one on a product name, one on a lifecycle chip. They are now the same five parts in the same
 * order, because the seller asks the same questions of all three:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>무엇인가</b> — a meta line (where it came from, how long it has waited) and the title;</li>
 *   <li><b>고객이 뭐라고 했나</b> — the subject, the largest body text on the screen;</li>
 *   <li><b>무엇을 확인했나</b> — what Reviewnary checked and found;</li>
 *   <li><b>내가 할 일</b> — the decision: the one place a primary action may stand;</li>
 *   <li><b>더 보기</b> — records and background, folded by the caller.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Two variants, same parts.</b> On a full page the decision stands in its own column beside the story and
 * follows the scroll. In the master-detail pane there is room for one column, and the order above is the order
 * it draws.
 *
 * <p><b>The pane used to put the decision straight after the customer's words</b> — 「never under the evidence,
 * below the fold」 — and that rule is retired (Review Decision UX v3.2, product-owner decision). It was written
 * to keep the decision on the first screen, and measurement showed it had stopped doing that: on 확인할 일 at
 * 1440×900 the decision block is <b>995px</b> tall, so 반복 신호 landed at y=1,191 and 이 상품에 대해 아는 것
 * at y=1,498 — the seller was asked to judge at y=201 and shown what was found a screen and a half below.
 * The rule bought nothing it promised and cost the thing it was protecting. The order is now
 * <b>고객 요청 → 확인한 사실 → 판매자 판단 → primary action</b>, and the promise it replaces is kept by
 * measurement instead: the primary action must stand inside the fold at 1440×900, 1366×768 and 1152×720.
 *
 * <p>The layout owns placement and nothing else: every read, write and word belongs to the screen that composes it.
