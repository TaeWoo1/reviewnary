/**
 * <b>The right-hand pane of 확인할 일 and 오늘</b> — the selected row, drawn where the seller already is.
 *
 * <p>Each kind is drawn by the screen that owns it, in its pane reading: a case by the case screen, a review by the
 * Review Case, an inquiry by the same response panel 문의 uses. Nothing is re-implemented here, so deciding in the
 * pane and deciding on the full page are the same reads and the same writes. `key` forces a clean mount per item: a
 * half-written draft must never follow the seller to the next row.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link PaneDepth} decides how much of that screen unfolds</b> (Home v3.1). At 「full」 the pane is the
 * workspace, as it has been. At 「preview」 every form is left to the screen that owns it and the pane answers the
 * questions a seller asks before opening anything — what this is, why it was brought up, what was checked, what is
 * recommended — with one way in docked under it. Same components, same state; what differs is what is offered,
 * never what is true.
