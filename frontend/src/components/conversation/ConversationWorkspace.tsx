/**
 * Transcript + composer over the ONE shared conversation — conversation-first (Chat UI v1).
 *
 * The transcript is the main surface and owns its own scroll; the composer is docked at the bottom of
 * the viewport (`flex` column: scroll area `flex-1 min-h-0`, composer after it — nothing floats below
 * the box). The home, the `/agent` page and the contextual panel all render this; the differences are
 * compactness (`compact` = the 400px panel), what sits above the thread (`lead`: the home's greeting
 * and context line, shown only while the conversation is empty), and the hints the surface registers.
 * Example prompts appear only on an EMPTY conversation — after the first message the thread speaks.
 * Outside the provider it renders nothing — a bare page render has no conversation to show.
