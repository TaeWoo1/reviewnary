/**
 * The one box (docs/reviewnary_design.md §8-A), docked at the bottom of the transcript (Chat UI v1).
 *
 * Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks a line; the box grows with the text up to ~8 lines and then scrolls.
 * ONE round control at the right edge: ArrowUp to send while idle, Stop while a turn is running — the
 * same place, so the seller's hand does not move. Stop is real: it closes the stream and the runtime
 * cancels the run's budget (`ConversationProvider.stop`) — the box never pretends. The approval
 * boundary is printed under a sentence that asks to send BEFORE the wait. The box never dispatches on
 * its own — a launcher lands nothing here, and a chip is a sentence the seller still has to send.
