/**
 * <b>How a piece of already-decided work reads on a Home — in one place, for every Home there is.</b>
 *
 * <p>Each row is something a record already says is ready: a reply the seller approved, a draft that exists, an
 * improvement they accepted. Nothing here is derived from 「이건 답장이 필요해 보인다」 — a Home that invented work
 * would be asking for something no record supports.
 *
 * <p><b>Every row is a link out and nothing else.</b> No button, no verb that sounds like dispatch: this product
 * has no dispatcher, and the seller finishes the work on the surface that owns it — the review's own reply screen,
 * the inquiry, the problem. Rendering a control here that looked like 「보내기」 would promise a send this
 * component cannot perform and no approval covers.
 *
 * <p>The distinguishing fact leads when there is one. Four rows reading 「승인된 리뷰 답변」 are four links a seller
 * cannot choose between; the kind of work follows as the quieter half.
 *
 * <p><b>Each row says what IT is waiting for.</b> The section above used to carry a single badge —
 * 「승인함 · 등록 전」 — which was a claim about a standing approval and was false of every inquiry row on the
 * list. The word now comes from the row's own record (`preparedStateWord`), and a row with nothing distinct
 * to say stays silent rather than repeating the same label down the column.
