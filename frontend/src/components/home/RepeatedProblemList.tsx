/**
 * <b>How a repeated problem reads on a Home — in one place, for every Home there is.</b>
 *
 * <p>There are two: the legacy 「오늘 확인할 것」 areas and 고객 운영 관리's. Until this component existed only the
 * first one drew these rows; the second collapsed the whole signal into 「관찰 중 20 · 보기」 — a count with no
 * problem in it, no product, no evidence, and a link to the list rather than to the problem. That is not a smaller
 * version of this row, it is a different claim, and the seller who saw it was the one whose org had eighteen pieces
 * of evidence for a single problem on a single product.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here judges anything.</b> The issue's lifecycle word, its severity and its trend labels are the
 * extractor's, printed verbatim; the count and its denominator are the per-product tally the problem's own screen
 * prints, from the same read. This component adds no number and derives none — in particular it never adds
 * {@code decidable} to {@code observing}, and never turns the pair into a rate.
 *
 * <p><b>It is not a task list.</b> No verb, no button, no {@code DecisionRow}: 관찰 중 means reviewnary concluded
 * nothing needs doing, and a Home that drew twenty observed problems as twenty pending tasks would be manufacturing
 * urgency out of an evidence trickle. Every row is a link out to the problem's own workspace, which is where a
 * decision about it is actually taken.
