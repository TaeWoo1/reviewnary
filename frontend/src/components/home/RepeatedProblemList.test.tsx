/**
 * <b>One renderer for a repeated problem, and it invents no number.</b>
 *
 * <p>The behaviour — what a row says and where it links — is asserted where a seller meets it, in
 * {@code CustomerOpsHome.test.tsx}. What cannot be asserted by rendering one Home is the property that made this
 * component exist: that the OTHER Home draws the same row. There are two Homes, only one of them was drawing these
 * rows, and the one that was not is the one a delegated organisation sees — so the divergence was invisible to every
 * test that rendered either screen on its own.
 *
 * <p>The second scan is the rule the whole repeated-problem surface rests on: this component may print numbers a read
 * returned and may not produce one of its own. The specific arithmetic banned here is the one that shipped —
 * {@code decidable + observing}, a sum of two populations the server documents as un-addable, printed under the name
 * of one of them.
