/**
 * <b>Operations Home — the four things a seller should see before they ask anything.</b>
 *
 * <p>지금 확인할 리뷰 · 반복 문제 · 최근 수집 상태 · 준비된 작업. Each area states one fact and hands
 * the work to the surface that owns it; none of them decides anything here, because a Home that could
 * also decide would be a second door onto every decision in the product.
 *
 * <p><b>Urgency is never invented, and three habits enforce that.</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>No area is ranked against another.</b> They sit side by side in a fixed order, because
 *       weighing a review against a stale channel would need a number nobody measured.</li>
 *   <li><b>「문제 N개」와 「지금 결정 필요 N개」가 다른 문장이다.</b> The tier total and the undecided
 *       count are different facts and are printed as different sentences; 관찰 중 problems are stated
 *       and never drawn as tasks.</li>
 *   <li><b>An area with nothing to say says so in one quiet line, and does not grow.</b></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>This does not replace the conversation.</b> It sits above the thread: chat-first, not
 * chat-only. Every row is a link out, so the Home is where a morning starts and never where it ends.
