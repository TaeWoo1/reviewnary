/**
 * **상품평** — the seller's own record of what buyers wrote on a connected channel.
 *
 * It is a record first, and a work surface only where the channel allows one. On a channel whose
 * capability says `replySupported` (NAVER), the detail panel carries the product's one reply flow
 * (리뷰 처리 화면: 대응 필요 → 답변 준비 → 승인 → 복사 → guided/manual handoff → outcome record) and
 * the page ends with 내 답변 작업 — moved here from the 채널 연결 workbench in product assembly A6, so
 * review work starts on the 리뷰 screen. Elsewhere there is no reply control, no draft, no "답변하기":
 * Coupang gives sellers no way to answer a 상품평, Cafe24 has no reply flow built, and an affordance
 * for a capability the channel does not have would be a promise the product cannot keep. The server
 * says which case this is (`ChannelReviewDetailView.replyWork` is null where there is no flow).
 *
 * **Review Triage v1 added an order and an explanation, not a queue.** The list opens 확인 필요 순,
 * every row says which tier it is in and why, and the summary says how the whole record divides.
 * Nothing is hidden unless the seller presses a filter, nothing is marked done, and no tier promises
 * that anything happens next — see `docs/slices/review-triage-v1.md`.
 *
 * **The tier comes from the rating and whether there is text to read, and from nothing else.** The
 * 분류 tags beside it are a stored keyword classification with unmeasured accuracy, so they are
 * rendered as citations under one plain disclosure and must never be used here to re-rank, re-colour
 * or re-sort a row. That boundary is `contracts/review-eval/naver/v1/RUBRIC.md` §5.
 *
 * **The page says what it does not know.** A list of reviews cannot tell a seller whether it is all
 * of their reviews — an import that stopped early looks exactly like a channel with fewer reviews.
 * So the last import's own coverage claim is rendered, and an incomplete one says so in words rather
 * than being left for the seller to infer from a number that looks fine.
 *
 * No buyer name appears anywhere, because none is stored: the acquisition path locates that column
 * on the screen precisely so it can refuse to read it.
