 * 홈 — the Agent operating workspace (Agentic Operating Workspace v2 §3-C).
 *
 * <b>Work-first, chat as a command bar (Home v3, 2026-09-23).</b> This docblock used to say 「the thread
 * is the page」 and had been wrong for some time: for an org with 고객 운영 관리 open, Home is
 * {@link TodayWorkspace} — the 확인할 일 list with the selected item beside it — and the conversation is a
 * one-line dock under the list. The design contract said the same stale thing and was corrected with this
 * (`docs/reviewnary_design.md` §8-A v3.2).
 *
 * <p>What the screen answers is unchanged — 「오늘 무엇을 해야 하지?」 — and the answer is the LIST. The top
 * carries only obligations (확인할 일 · 실행 대기); 반복 문제 keeps its own section below the work because it
 * is a pattern, not a customer waiting; KPI, trend and per-channel numbers stay at `/overview` and are not
 * copied here. Nothing is chosen until the seller chooses it, and what they chose can be closed.
 *
 * <p>For an org WITHOUT that job, this page is still the thread: an EMPTY thread opens with a greeting that
 * is arithmetic (hour + the count of prepared cases — no model writes it), ONE muted context line with the
 * three numbers, the first agent turn client-composed from 「AI가 먼저 확인한 일」 — a truthful zero when
 * there is nothing — and example prompts under the box.
 *
 * <b>The palette is a shortcut, not a planner.</b> A typed sentence that is exactly one of three
 * labels answers locally with an object the page already has; every other sentence goes to the
 * runtime, where the planner plans it or the turn fails.

 * {@link CustomerOpsHome}'s band says, so a seller whose org opens the job and a seller whose org does not
 * read the same two words for the same two facts. Two names twelve pixels apart on two variants of one
 * screen is how one product starts reading as two.
 *
 * <p>`briefNamesInquiries` = the opener turn below is naming the waiting inquiries and their count, so
 * this line drops that number rather than printing it a second time six inches above (§5). With the other
 * two retired, that leaves nothing — and nothing is the correct render: the brief already said it.
