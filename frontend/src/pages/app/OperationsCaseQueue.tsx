 * <b>The queue</b> — everything waiting for the seller's decision, in one list.
 *
 * <p>The Home briefs the first few of exactly this list; this screen is the rest of it. <b>That sentence was
 * false.</b> The Home's 「확인 필요」 has been {@link mergeHomeWork} — cases, the reviews triage marked 지금 확인, and
 * the inquiry work queue, deduplicated by owning screen — since Customer Operations v3.1, while this screen read
 * cases alone. Measured on the demo org: the Home said 27건 and 확인할 일, the sidebar entry a seller reaches for
 * first, said 1건. Two screens under one name, one of them missing twenty-six items.
 *
 * <p>So it draws the same list, with the same composer. The only difference left is depth: the case half comes from
 * the dedicated decisions read rather than the Home's briefing-sized slice, because this screen exists to be the
 * whole of what the Home shortens.
 *
 * <p><b>A partial read is drawn, not refused.</b> Four reads answer this list and they fail independently; showing
 * nothing because one of them failed would hide work that was read successfully. Only a list where nothing could be
 * read at all says so.
 *
 * <p><b>문의와 리뷰를 가르지 않는다.</b> What a row says comes from the decision it carries, and its subject kind is
 * one fact in the row rather than the list it belongs to. A case opens the case screen, which carries this whole
 * queue so 「다음 건」 walks the morning; everything else opens the screen that owns it.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here decides anything.</b> No control on this screen resolves, dismisses or sends; the case screen
 * and the inquiry/review screens it links to still own every write.
 *
 * <p><b>Master-detail (UI/UX v2 Phase 1).</b> On a wide screen the selected row opens beside the list — drawn by the
 * very screen that owns it ({@link WorkItemPane}) — so the morning is worked without leaving the list.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing is selected until the seller selects something</b> (Review Decision UX v3.2 — product-owner
 * decision). This screen used to open the first row because 「an empty right half is a page waiting for a click」,
 * and that reasoning was right about a screen whose job is the one item in front of you. Measured, this is not
 * that screen: it opens on 45 rows, five filters and a 5,407px list, and its name is 확인할 일 — it is a screen
 * for looking through. The cost of the old default was the one 오늘 already paid: a 556px column of judgment
 * forms for a row nobody chose, no way to close it, and a URL that could not express 「none」. Same contract as
 * the Home now: no {@code item} is closed, {@code item=<key>} is that row, a key that matches nothing is closed,
 * and 닫기/Esc put it back. Closed, the list takes the width the pane was holding.
