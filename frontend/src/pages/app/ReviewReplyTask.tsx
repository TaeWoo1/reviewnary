/**
 * <b>리뷰 처리 — the Review Decision Workspace.</b>
 *
 * <p>One review, and everything needed to decide it, in the order a person decides:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>what the customer said, and</li>
 *   <li>why it is in front of them ({@link ReviewProblemCard});</li>
 *   <li>whether anyone has said it before ({@link RepeatedSignal});</li>
 *   <li>what a reply would stand on ({@link GroundingOnHand});</li>
 *   <li>what the SELLER thinks ({@link SellerCorrectionControls});</li>
 *   <li>what they will DO ({@link DecisionActionStep});</li>
 *   <li>the draft that follows from that choice, and only from 대응 필요;</li>
 *   <li>what has already been decided ({@link DecisionLog}).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>What this screen was before.</b> Review Approval Path v1 built it as 답변 작업 — an address for
 * one review's approve button, which was the right fix for the problem it had (the button sat at
 * y=5,425 of a 5,587px record). But it opened on a draft: the customer's sentence and the reason the
 * review was ranked were folded away under 「이 리뷰의 자동 분류」, the seller's own judgment lived on a
 * different screen, the repeated problems were one muted line with no examples, and what the company
 * had written down was not mentioned at all. A seller could approve here; they could not DECIDE here.
 * Everything this page now shows already existed — on five screens, none of them this one.
 *
 * <p><b>Reuse, not replacement.</b> The reply lane is untouched: the same {@link VocItemReplyPrep}
 * panel, the same append-only draft versions, the same approval boundary and fingerprint, the same
 * copy-then-post handoff. The decision is the same `TriageDisposition` through the same endpoint with
 * the same idempotency key and audit trail. The seller's judgment is T-07's correction, unchanged. The
 * log invents no store: it reads trails that were already being written.
 *
 * <p><b>Three reads open it</b> — the review, the decision context, the decision log — and the last two
 * are deliberately separate from the first: neither is needed to answer a customer, so neither may
 * delay or fail the panel that does. A failed context or log renders nothing rather than an absence
 * claim about something the screen never saw.
 *
 * <p><b>Addressed by the review alone</b> (Agent-native Core Boundary v1). `/reviews/reply/:reviewId`
 * IS this page now — it used to resolve an account and redirect, and a review with no account to
 * resolve hit a dead end that said so in as many words. Every read and write above is org-scoped; the
 * account arrives as a FACT on the detail (`sellerAccountId`) and is used for exactly the two things
 * that are genuinely account-shaped: the reply panel, and the link back to that channel's record.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing on this page posts to a marketplace.</b> The only writes are the ones the product
 * already had, and every one of them lands in reviewnary's own database.
