/**
 * <b>The 문의 workspace: what is waiting on the seller, and the record of everything else.</b>
 *
 * Two reads, because they answer two questions and the product already had both:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>지금 처리할 일</b> — `GET /api/inquiries?phase=…`, the WORK QUEUE over
 *       `InquiryWorkItem`. Its membership rule is not invented here: `InquiryWorkItemPhase
 *       .AWAITING_SELLER` = {OPEN, PROPOSED} is declared once in the backend as "the phases where the
 *       work is still waiting for the SELLER to decide something", and every recommendation surface
 *       reads it. A phase added later has to be classified there, not guessed at here.</li>
 *   <li><b>전체 문의</b> — `GET /api/inquiries/rows`, the inquiries themselves, filtered server-side
 *       and bounded, with the whole set's count beside the page.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Why not one list.</b> The screen used to read 500 rows and render every one of them in a single
 * column: 94 rows and 7,100px on the demo org, with an answered inquiry from last week at the same
 * weight as the oldest unanswered one, and nothing to search with. A pilot seller with three thousand
 * inquiries would have got three thousand rows. The queue is bounded by how much work exists; the
 * record is bounded by a page and found by searching.
 *
 * <b>The same object may appear in both, and that is not a duplicated fact.</b> A row in the queue is
 * there as WORK; the same row in the record is there as a RECORD. 리뷰 has read this way since Review
 * Approval Path v1 — its 목록 holds all 4,455 including the four in 내 답변 작업.

 * package measured why: this org's Cafe24 backlog reaches back a decade, and sorted purely worst-first
 * a 2014 question wore the same weight as one from an hour ago and buried it. So the criterion is
 * applied INSIDE two groups rather than across them. The old rows are not hidden, not dropped and not
 * reordered away — they sit under their own quiet divider, which is the same idiom the 문의 list has
 * used since Executive-friendly UX Redesign v1.
