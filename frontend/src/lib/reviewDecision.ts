 * How the Decision Workspace reads — the words for the decisions the product already records.

 * `ReviewTriageTier`, the recorded act is `TriageActionKind`, the approval is
 * `ReviewReplyApprovalState`, the outcome is `OperatorOutcomeName`. A workspace that invented its

 * (`TRIAGE_OPTIONS`: 대응 필요 / 지켜보기 / 조치 불필요) — a workspace that renamed them would leave the
 * worklist, the record and the audit trail describing the same three values in different words. What
 * the workspace adds is the sentence UNDER them, and that sentence is channel-aware because the
 * promise is: on a channel with a reply flow 「대응 필요」 opens a draft, and on one without it
 * (Coupang 상품평, per the capability table) it opens nothing and must not pretend to.
