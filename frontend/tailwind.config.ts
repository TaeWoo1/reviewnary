          target, final polish).

          <p>The target asks for a 28px page title over a 20px section title, and the scale ran
          18 → 22 → 26 → 32. Fitting the design to the nearest existing step was the wrong move twice over:
          at `xl`/`lg` the page title stood 4px above its own sections, and at `2xl`/`lg` the figures in the
          summary band were a step the rest of the product never spends. So the SCALE grows rather than the
          design bending — these two are named for the role they carry, because that is what makes them
          re-usable by the next screen brought onto the system instead of guessed at again.

          <p>`title` is the page's `h1` AND the one primary metric a screen may draw (both 28/700): on this
          product a Home's 「46건」 is a title — it is what the screen is about — and giving the two the same
          step is what stops a band of figures from out-shouting the name of the page it sits under.
          `section` is the `h2` every screen's regions take.
