/**
 * <b>Who is allowed to write a memory</b> — asserted on the source, because the property is an
 * absence and an absence has no runtime to test.
 *
 * <p>The whole value of Answer Memory rests on it containing only what the seller actually did. The
 * failure mode is not dramatic: someone adds "remember the draft we just generated" to make a demo
 * look smarter, and from then on the model reads its own unapproved output back as precedent. Every
 * citation still says "판매자의 과거 답변", so nothing looks wrong — which is exactly why this is a
 * fence and not a code review note.
 *
 * <p>Three writers exist and every one records a completed human act: the importer, for an answer the
 * channel says the seller published; the inquiry publish hook, for an approval and a verified send;
 * and — since Review Delivery Truth Spine v1 — the review lane's hook, for the same two acts on a
 * review reply. The draft composer is not on the list and adding it must fail here.
 *
 * <p><b>Adding the third was a deliberate widening, and the fence is what made it deliberate.</b> The
 * property being protected is not «two writers»; it is that every writer records something a person
 * actually did. A fourth entry still has to earn its line in {@link #ALLOWED} with a sentence naming
 * which human act it remembers.
