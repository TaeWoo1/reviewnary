/**
 * The approval races, driven to an exact interleaving. A focused mirror of
 * {@code ReviewTriageConcurrencyTest}, whose class notes explain the arrangement in full; the
 * essentials are restated here only where this class would be unreadable without them.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @SpringBootTest}, not {@code @DataJpaTest}</b>: the latter wraps each test in
 * one transaction and rolls it back, so two "concurrent" calls would share a transaction and
 * never contend — every race would be structurally unreachable and every test would pass green
 * while proving nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Deterministic, not hopeful</b>: each test stalls one caller at a known point via a
 * test-side gated repository decorator, drives the other to commit, then releases the first.
 * Each also asserts the recovery path ACTUALLY RAN, so a test that stops exercising it fails
 * rather than passes quietly. Production code has no test hook.
 *
 * <p>Its own database, because it commits — see the triage class's note on why a committing
 * class on the shared {@code sellerops_test} instance breaks unrelated suites.
 *
 * <p>Hermetic: no network, no marketplace, no credentials; every body is synthetic.
