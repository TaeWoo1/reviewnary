/**
 * <b>What the Opportunity Engine is not allowed to do</b> — asserted on the source, because every
 * property here is an absence.
 *
 * <p>An opportunity is a suggestion about where the seller can act, derived from evidence the product
 * already holds. What keeps it honest is that the code has no way to reach a marketplace, no way to
 * approve or send anything, no model to invent a cause with, and no writer into the knowledge library
 * — the draft it prepares leaves this package only through the seller's own hand.
