/**
 * The fourth RUBRIC §5 gate, made structural.
 *
 * <p>{@code contracts/review-eval/naver/v1/RUBRIC.md} §5's regression bar is
 * "{@code LOW_RATING_REVIEW} counts unchanged — a detector may only ADD". Review Triage v1 satisfies
 * it today by construction: it is a read-side suggestion on the channel review record and touches
 * neither the attention surface nor anything the attention surface reads. But "today, by
 * construction" is a property of the code as written, not a rule, and the whole point of a
 * pre-committed gate is that it survives the next edit.
 *
 * <p>So it is asserted the way {@code ReviewIssueQueueIsolationTest} asserts the same boundary for
 * the issue-memory package: structurally, over the package's own sources, rather than by checking a
 * count in one scenario and hoping.
 *
 * <p><b>Comments are stripped before scanning.</b> This package's javadoc legitimately names the
 * attention surface when explaining what it is NOT — the naming section in {@code ReviewTriageTier}
 * exists precisely to distinguish the two — and a guard that failed on its own explanation would be
 * deleted rather than fixed.
