/**
 * Deterministic, read-time redactor for raw VOC text (a review/inquiry title or body).
 * Channel-generic and fail-closed: it MAKES the text plain itself (no channel logic) and, when in
 * doubt, redacts rather than emit risky content.
 *
 * <p>Conservative by design and <b>not</b> a guarantee of perfect PII removal. It
 * reuses {@link PiiMasker} for phone/email and adds URLs, resident-registration /
 * card / bank-like numbers, long numeric IDs, messenger handles, token/secret-like
 * blobs, file paths, and a narrow Korean-address heuristic. Each match becomes a
 * fixed {@code [...]} token. Pure: no DB, no clock, no logging of the input.
 *
 * <p><b>The markup boundary is here, and it is first (2026-10-05).</b> Both entry points begin with
 * {@link MarkupText#toPlainText}, so a caller cannot forget it. That used to be the caller's job and
 * half of them did not do it: seven of the fourteen sanitize sites wrapped the body first, seven did
 * not, and the seven that did not are exactly the surfaces where markup reached a seller —
 * {@code ChannelReviewService} ({@code /api/reviews/record}), {@code ReviewReplyService}'s
 * {@code redactedBody}, the two attention sources, both home services, and the issue-evidence quote.
 *
 * <p><b>Order is the whole fix.</b> {@link #truncate} runs LAST, so on a body still carrying tags the
 * 60-character preview spends its sixty characters on attributes and ends mid-tag — measured on this
 * deployment, a Cafe24 row arrived as
 * {@code 큰 컵이 안들어가 아쉬워요, 둘레가 넓은게 따로 있나요? <span style='color:}. Nothing downstream could
 * repair that: the closing {@code >} had already been thrown away, and the frontend's defensive
 * {@code lib/plainText.ts} matches {@code <[^>]*>} only. Plain text first means the sixty characters
 * are sixty characters a person wrote, and it means the screen, the retrieval query, the model
 * payload and the draft all read the same letters.
 *
 * <p><b>Stripping markup is not redacting.</b> {@code SafePreviewResult.status} and
 * {@code RedactedBody.redacted()} are both computed against the PLAIN text, so a body that merely
 * carried tags still reports SAFE / not-redacted. Only {@link #redact} can flip them.
 *
 * <p><b>Two entry points over one rule set</b>, differing only in what they do after
 * redacting:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #sanitize(String)} — the <b>preview</b>: one line, 60 characters, suppressed
 *       entirely when too little real text survives. For a list row, where the operator is
 *       recognising an item rather than reading it, and where showing nothing costs them
 *       nothing.
 *   <li>{@link #redactFullBody(String)} — the <b>whole body</b>: no truncation, no
 *       suppression, line structure preserved. For the reply-preparation surface, where the
 *       operator must actually read the complaint to answer it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both run the identical {@link #redact} pipeline over identically-shaped input, and both
 * halves of that matter. Sharing {@code redact} alone is NOT enough to make them agree: what
 * gets redacted is a function of {@code redact} ∘ normalization, and several patterns admit
 * only a single separator character, so a path that left a two-character whitespace run in
 * place would silently redact less while appearing to share every rule. That is why
 * {@link #normalizeForRedaction} is shared too, and why it guarantees no whitespace run
 * reaches {@code redact} longer than one character. The two paths may differ on presentation
 * — one line vs many — never on how much whitespace {@code redact} sees.
 *
 * <p><b>Why full-body exposure is not a hole in the preview's fail-closed rule.</b> The
 * preview's suppression is a <i>display</i> judgement — a 60-character snippet that is
 * mostly {@code [번호]} tells the operator nothing, so it shows nothing. It was never a
 * claim that the redacted text is unsafe to show; the redaction is what makes it safe, and
 * the redaction is the same here. Product scope v1.4 records the seller-facing exception
 * (§9) that authorizes this surface; the collector's sanitized-output contract is untouched
 * and is a different rule about a different boundary.
