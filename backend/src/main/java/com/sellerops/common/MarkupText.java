/**
 * Turn a stored body that happens to carry markup into the text a person wrote.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> The first browser render of 문의 showed the Cafe24 backlog as
 * {@code <br /> [ Original Message ] <p>...}, {@code &nbsp;}, and one row whose entire preview was
 * {@code <table border="1" style='width: 1240px; border-width: 0px 1p…}. The board API returns the
 * post exactly as the customer's mail client or the shop's editor wrote it, and the product was
 * cutting the first 60 characters of that — which on an HTML body is 60 characters of attributes.
 * The seller could not read their own queue.
 *
 * <p><b>Display boundary only.</b> The stored body is never rewritten: it is the record of what the
 * customer sent, and a lossy normalisation is not a thing to persist. This runs on the way OUT — the
 * feed snippet, the inquiry detail the seller reads, and the draft payload the model reads. The model
 * matters as much as the screen: a question wrapped in {@code <table>} attributes is a question the
 * model answers badly.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a sanitizer, and not a renderer.</b> It produces plain text that is then escaped by
 * whatever renders it (React escapes by construction; nothing here is ever set as HTML). Entity
 * decoding runs AFTER tag removal, so a body containing {@code &lt;script&gt;} becomes the literal
 * text {@code <script>} — visible characters, never an element.
 *
 * <p><b>That order also hid a defect, and {@link #DOCUMENT_METADATA} is the exception it needs.</b> A
 * preamble that arrives ESCAPED survives the tag pass ({@code &lt;} is not {@code <}) and the decode
 * pass then materializes it. Measured 2026-09-27 on the demo organisation: five Cafe24 inquiries —
 * the two newest among them — carry {@code &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;} as their first
 * characters, so the seller's screen, the retrieval query and the draft payload all began with
 * {@code <meta charset="utf-8">}. It is removed once more after decoding. <b>Only the named element
 * is</b>: a second generic pass over decoded text would delete a customer's own 「&lt;급함&gt;」 and
 * would break the {@code &lt;script&gt;} sentence above.
