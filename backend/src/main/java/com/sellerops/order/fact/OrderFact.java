/**
 * The minimum operational truth about one order that a reply may be grounded in.
 *
 * <p><b>A projection, not a payload.</b> A marketplace order object carries the buyer's name, email,
 * phone, address, recipient, billing name, bank account holder, transaction ids and amounts — the
 * vendored Cafe24 contract lists all of them
 * ({@code docs/vendor/cafe24-admin-api/get-orders-order-id.md}). None of that answers "취소됐나요?"
 * or "언제 발송되나요?", and all of it would then be in a prompt, a log, and a draft. So this record
 * names the fields that answer operational questions and has no field for anything else — a
 * projection cannot leak what it has no room for.
 *
 * <p><b>No order identifier either.</b> The reference lives on the inquiry row where the join needs
 * it; it is not carried out here, because every consumer of this record — the drafter, the screen,
 * the coverage audit — answers a question about STATE and none of them needs the handle.
 *
 * <p><b>Three states, deliberately separate — and the platform agrees.</b> Cafe24 publishes
 * {@code paid}, {@code canceled} and {@code shipping_status} as three independent fields with three
 * independent vocabularies, each of the first two carrying a partial value. Folding them into one
 * "status" is how "결제완료" comes to be read as "발송 안 됨" — which is not implied by it and is
 * sometimes false.
 *
 * @param state         whether this may be spoken about at all, and why not when it may not
 * @param provenance    which source produced it; {@code null} when there is no fact. Decides whether
 *                      a NEGATIVE may be stated — see {@link OrderFactProvenance}
 * @param channelState  the channel-level freshness axis this was derived from, kept because the
 *                      REMEDIES differ ({@code NOT_CONNECTED} → 연결해 주세요, {@code BLOCKED} →
 *                      연결이 끊겼습니다) even where the drafter's behaviour does not
 * @param channelCode   whose order this is; a claim about NAVER must be checkable as one
 * @param payment       whether it is paid, per the source, or {@link OrderPaymentState#UNKNOWN}
 * @param cancellation  whether it is cancelled; {@link OrderCancellationState#NOT_CANCELLED} only
 *                      ever from an exact read
 * @param fulfillment   where it is on the way to the customer. Never a date
 * @param rawStatusCode the channel's own code, verbatim, so a later correction is possible without
 *                      re-collecting. Never shown to a customer and never sent to a model
 * @param paidAt        when payment completed, when the channel said so
 * @param cancelledAt   when the channel recorded the cancellation
 * @param statusChangedAt when the channel last moved this order
 * @param orderedAt     the KST calendar day the order belongs to
 * @param asOf          when SellerOps last SAW this order. The date a citation must carry when
 *                      {@code state} is {@link OrderFactState#OBSERVED_FRESHNESS_UNPROVEN}
