/**
 * <b>What an unattended NAVER review read may hand back: the rows it read, and nothing about who wrote them.</b>
 *
 * <p>The Seller Center row model carries the buyer's masked id, member number and order number beside every
 * review. None of them has a field here, and unknown properties are refused rather than ignored, so a helper that
 * sent one would be told so instead of quietly succeeding — the same posture as the Coupang handoff.
 *
 * <p>{@code windowDays} is the screen's own period as the helper measured it. It is recorded as the bound this
 * read covered, and it is why a run of this recipe is {@code BOUNDED}: a read of a period is never a read of a
 * store's history.
 *
 * <p><b>The period, and the ceiling.</b> {@code windowStart} / {@code windowEnd} are that same period as two KST
 * dates, and {@code rowCapacity} is the largest reading this one read could have carried. Together they are what
 * lets a boundary move: 45 rows under a ceiling of 500 for 10-02 … 10-08 proves those seven days; the same 45 rows
 * with no dates and no ceiling prove only that a read happened. All three are optional, because a helper built
 * before them says nothing rather than something false — such a read stores its rows and moves no boundary.
 *
 * @param windowStart first day of the period the screen showed, {@code YYYY-MM-DD} in KST
 * @param windowEnd   last day of it
 * @param rowCapacity the ceiling that reading was under — the backend compares the row count against it rather
 *                    than trusting a «complete» flag, so saturation is judged where the comparison can be checked
