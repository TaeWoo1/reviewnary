     * <p><b>The SQL half of a rule whose Java half is {@code ReviewTriageRules}.</b> Both exist
     * because the tier must both render (per row, in Java) and sort/count (across pages the service
     * never loads, in the database). Stated ONCE here and shared by the ordering, the filter and the
     * summary count, for the same reason {@link #REPORTED_SUBMISSION_PREDICATE} is shared: three
     * numbers read together on one screen must not be able to disagree about what they mean. The two
     * halves are pinned equal over the rule's entire input space — every (rating × body) combination
     * — by {@code ChannelReviewTriageIT}.
     *
     * <p>The literal ranks mirror {@code ReviewTriageRules.rank}, which names them deliberately
     * rather than taking an enum ordinal. Changing either without the other fails that test.
     *
     * <p><b>Blankness, and the one place it is narrower than Java.</b> {@code trim(r.body) = ''} is
     * the portable expression available in JPQL (the offline suite runs H2 in PostgreSQL mode), and
     * SQL {@code TRIM} strips {@code U+0020} alone. {@code ReviewTriageRules.isTextless} uses
     * {@code String.isBlank}, i.e. {@code Character.isWhitespace}. <b>The divergent set is therefore
     * every whitespace code point except {@code U+0020}</b> — not merely tabs and newlines, but also
     * {@code U+3000} IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE, which a Korean IME emits, and the whole {@code U+2000–U+200A}
     * block. A body made only of those ranks 확인 필요 here while rendering as 별점만.
     *
     * <p>The claim that keeps this benign is that no ingest path stores such a body, and it was
     * checked rather than assumed: the Coupang collector normalises {@code \s| |　} and trims
     * ({@code review-row-inpage.ts}), then maps the result to {@code ""} ({@code review-rows.ts}); the
     * upload path uses {@code String.strip()} ({@code ingest/parse/FileParser}), which strips
     * {@code U+3000}; {@code Cafe24ReviewPromoter} rejects {@code isBlank} content outright.
     *
     * <p><b>The direction is not uniformly safe</b>, so do not lean on that as the reason. On the
     * count and the default order the disagreement over-surfaces, which is harmless. Under
     * {@code tier=WATCH} it does the opposite: the row is filtered OUT while its own chip reads
     * 지켜보기, so it becomes unreachable through the filter that matches what it says. The reason
