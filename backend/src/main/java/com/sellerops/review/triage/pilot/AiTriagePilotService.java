/**
 * Runs the frozen candidate over an account's reviews and records what it said. RUBRIC v2 §13.7.
 *
 * <p><b>Bounded, operator-triggered, and additive.</b> A run classifies at most
 * {@link AiTriagePilotProperties#maxPerRun()} reviews the pilot has not yet seen under the current
 * classifier version, records every answer — including failures — through
 * {@link TriageFeedbackService#record}, and stops. Nothing here changes a review, and nothing here
 * can lower a tier: the only thing the read path consults is the additive mark that method writes.
 *
 * <p><b>The channel is checked at the boundary, not here.</b> This service does not compare channel
 * codes against a list of its own; it hands the code to {@link ReviewTriageChannelGate}, which refuses
 * anything outside {@link ReviewTriageChannelCapability}'s three channels as {@code UNCLASSIFIED}. The
 * refusal is still recorded — a run that quietly did nothing on such an account would look identical
 * to a run that classified it and found nothing. The one thing this service does with the code is the
 * contract-§1 door: an account on a channel outside the contract gets a 404 from run and funnel alike,
 * before any pending row is even counted.
 *
 * <p><b>No marketplace write, ever.</b> The pilot reads stored reviews and writes to SellerOps' own
 * tables. The human-in-the-loop boundary is untouched.
