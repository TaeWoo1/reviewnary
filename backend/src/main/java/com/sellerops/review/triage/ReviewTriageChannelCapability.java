/**
 * The three-channel capability table of {@code contracts/review-triage-events/v1/CONTRACT.md} §1 —
 * as one value per channel, read by the boundary, the endpoints and (on the wire) the UI.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the only place the table is stated.</b> {@code ReviewTriageChannelGate} asks it
 * whether a review may be classified; {@code ChannelReviewFeedbackService} asks it whether an event
 * kind is one this channel can produce; {@code ChannelReviewService} puts it on the page so the UI
 * renders no control the server would refuse. A channel that is not in the table gets
 * {@link #OUTSIDE}: nothing is permitted, and the answer is the same from every reader.
 *
 * <p>The values are facts about the product as built, not about the marketplaces in the abstract:
 * NAVER "reply" is the attention surface's guided composer flow (filled is never posted); Coupang has
 * no reply feature at all (policy gate D8) and no reply event may ever be written for it. "See the
 * original" is a Coupang locate run and nothing else — no channel has a per-review URL SellerOps could
 * honestly link.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code replySupported} is not "does a reply flow exist".</b> It is the triage contract's own
 * older column, and it is NAVER-only. Cafe24 is {@code false} here and nonetheless has a built reply
 * lane — the board-comment API adapter — which is what {@link #replyFlowExists()} answers. This
 * docblock used to say "Cafe24 has no reply flow built", contradicting the method two screens below
 * it; it was written before that lane existed and nobody came back.
