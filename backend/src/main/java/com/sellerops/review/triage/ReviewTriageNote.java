 *
 * <p><b>Computed at read time, stored nowhere.</b> There is no triage table behind this and no
 * control that writes one — a 확인 필요 row stays 확인 필요. That is a deliberate v1 boundary
 * ({@code docs/slices/review-triage-v1.md} §6): a half-integration with
 * {@code attention.triage.ReviewTriage}, which records a HUMAN's decision reached on a different
 * screen, would make a row's appearance depend on which surface the operator happened to use.
 *
 * <p><b>The reason explains; it does not decide.</b> {@link #reason} and {@link #tags} may name
 * body-derived material, but {@link #tier} was already fixed by {@link ReviewTriageRules} from the
 * rating and the presence of text alone. Nothing here can move a review between tiers, and
 * {@code ReviewTriageNoteTest} pins that.
