/**
 * Writes the three records of {@code docs/slices/llm-triage-classifier-v1.md} §6, and refuses to
 * blur them.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here trains anything.</b> A correction changes no running classifier and rewrites no
 * gold label. It becomes a row that a person later dispositions, and only the
 * {@link CorrectionDispositionKind#CLASSIFIER_ERROR} half of that ever reaches an evaluation set — a
 * frozen, numbered snapshot, offline, against the NEXT classifier version.
 *
 * <p><b>One surface reads one of these, additively.</b> RUBRIC v2 §13.7's conservative pilot lets
 * {@link AiTriageCurrent#isAiAttention()} raise a review the rule left lower and mark it
 * {@code AI 확인 필요}. It may not lower anything, it does not own {@code WATCH}/{@code FYI}, and it is
 * a candidate's suggestion displayed as such — never merged into the rules tier. Everything else
 * here is written to be measured, not read.
 *
 * <p><b>Three strengths of evidence, in three tables</b> (feedback draft §7): a correction and an
 * action are explicit — the seller answered a question or pressed a control that says what they did.
 * A behaviour event is silver — a trace of navigation, weighted at snapshot time, never a label.
