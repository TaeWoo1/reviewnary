/**
 * Executes an APPROVED review reply at its channel (API lane, Cafe24) and records what the guided
 * lane observed (NAVER) — the one service behind {@code POST …/reply/execute},
 * {@code POST …/reply/execution/observe} and {@code GET …/reply/execution}.
 *
 * <p><b>Every gate the approval seam already has, plus three of its own.</b> The ref is authorized
 * the way {@code ReviewReplyService} authorizes it (org from the JWT, account in org, review in org,
 * review on the account's channel); an APPROVED head must stand and the client's
 * {@code expectedFingerprint} must be that head's (a stale screen sends nothing); the review's
 * {@link ExecutableIdentity} must be {@code MARKETPLACE} (a file cannot be answered at a channel);
 * and the channel's {@link ReviewExecutionCapability} must be {@code API_EXECUTION} — the flag, the
 * connector and the seller's write grant, each with its own reason when it is not.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent on {@code commandId}, org-scoped</b>, with the UNIQUE index as the correctness
 * boundary and the lookup as the fast path — the pattern {@code ReviewReplyOutcomeService} uses.
 * A replay returns the recorded row; a command id reused for a different review or head is a 409.
 * Because a POST is not idempotent at the channel, the row is written once per command and the
 * transport is never retried by anything here.
 *
 * <p><b>Guided lane.</b> {@link #observe} appends the collector's report against the single-use
 * {@code submissionRef} the guided run was minted with, refuses a state that goes backwards, and
 * never promotes past {@code SELLER_SUBMISSION_OBSERVED}. {@link #read} performs the read-back step:
 * when the stored review now says {@code ANSWERED} (a later channel read), the observation becomes
 * {@code SUBMISSION_OBSERVED_CONTENT_UNVERIFIED} — and no further, because NAVER exposes no reply
 * body to compare. {@code VERIFIED} is unreachable for NAVER today, by construction.
 *
 * <p>No {@code @Transactional}: the API lane makes a network call between two writes, and a
 * transaction spanning it would hold a row lock across a marketplace round trip.
