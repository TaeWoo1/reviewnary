/**

 * <p>The answer for Cafe24 is not a constant: it is {@code API_EXECUTION} only while the adapter bean
 * exists (execution flag AND Cafe24 connector on) and THIS seller's mall recorded a
 * {@code mall.write_community} grant. Each miss has its own {@link ReviewExecutionReason} so the
 * screen and the Agent can say which switch is off instead of "not supported". NAVER is a guided
 * browser flow regardless of configuration; Coupang has no reply feature (policy gate D8).
