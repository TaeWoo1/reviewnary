/**
 * The channel review record for one connected account — list, detail, and the one thing a seller can ask
 * SellerOps to DO with a 상품평: show it to them on Coupang's own screen.
 *
 * <p>There is still no reply endpoint here, and its absence is the design: Coupang gives sellers no way to
 * answer a 상품평, so a draft or submit route would be an affordance for a capability the channel does not
 * have. The reply surfaces that exist elsewhere are bound to channels that can actually post.
 *
 * <p>The locate route mints a binding; it opens nothing and reads nothing. What acts on it is the seller's
 * own Local Agent, which resolves the ref over its own session and then only reads and rings.
 *
 * <p>{@code orgId} always comes from the authenticated principal, never the client, like every sibling read.
