 * already has a session slot (the handoff resolves the account by slot, so a run with no slot would
 * read the screen and then have no route to hand its reading back — refused here instead of ten
 * seconds later in the seller's browser). <b>Resolve</b> runs for the Local Agent under its own JWT
 * and spends the token once.

     * must not read one, and picking the oldest would answer a question nobody asked.
     *
     * <p>Connection status is deliberately not a condition. This lane reads the seller's own authenticated

     * connection (evidence 2026-09-14); requiring CONNECTED here would refuse a read that demonstrably works.
