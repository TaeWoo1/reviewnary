/**
 * One channel review, read in full — and the target that finds it again on the seller's own screen.
 *
 * <p>{@code body} is the redacted full text ({@code VocPreviewSanitizer.redactFullBody}): line structure
 * kept, nothing truncated, volatile PII-shaped spans tokenized. {@code bodyRedacted} says whether anything
 * was replaced, so the operator knows they are reading a redaction rather than wondering.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code locateTarget} is what the seller is shown about how the review is identified</b> — the
 * 노출상품ID and 옵션ID the 상세 panel prints, beside the date and rating it already shows.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately NOT the target a locate run matches on. Coupang publishes no review id, so
 * `[쿠팡에서 보기]` re-finds the review by product, option, date, rating and the body's
 * {@code review-body-fingerprint/v1} — and that fingerprint reaches the Local Agent by resolving an opaque
 * {@code locateRef} against {@link com.sellerops.review.channel.ChannelReviewLocateService}, never through
 * the browser. It used to ride here as well; nothing in the frontend read it, and a fingerprint of a
 * buyer's review sitting in a page nobody uses it in is a copy that exists for no reason.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code replyWork} is the one place this record touches the reply flow</b> (product assembly A6). It is
 * the server-minted address of the review's reply work plus the two facts the panel mounts on — the operator's
 * current decision and whether a draft or approval already exists — and it is {@code null} for every channel
 * whose capability says {@code replySupported = false}. Coupang gives sellers no way to answer a 상품평 and
 * Cafe24 has no reply flow built, so on those channels there is still no reply field, no draft, and no submit
 * affordance: the surface renders no control the server would refuse. There is never a body here — the draft's
 * text and the approval's state come from the reply read, addressed by {@code actionRef}.
