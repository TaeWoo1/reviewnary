/**
 * The bounded set of query candidates one question is searched as — shared by the product library,
 * the operating rules and the answer memory (Retrieval &amp; Grounding Correctness v1, 2026-08-30).
 *
 * <p><b>Why candidates, not one string.</b> {@link KnowledgeRetriever}'s absence gate is a ratio over
 * the question's content words: how many characters of what was asked does the corpus have any word
 * for. It is the right gate for a customer's question — 「방수 되나요?」 against a molding library is
 * rightly 0.0 — and the wrong input is a sentence that is mostly not the question: a title glued to a
 * body glued to a planner's instruction (「…명시돼 있는지 확인해줘」) carries a dozen content words no
 * note contains, and the ratio sinks under them although the two words that matter are right there.
 * Live (2026-08-29): 「반품 조건」 found the product's own 「교환 및 반품 안내」 at 1.0, and the planner's
 * sentence about the same document found nothing. Lowering the ratio would admit every coincidence;
 * the fix is to ask the SAME question in shorter forms and let the same gates judge each.
 *
 * <p><b>The candidates, in the order they are tried.</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code TOPIC} — a structured topic the caller already resolved (a plan filter, a routed noun).
 *       The narrowest statement of what is asked; nothing to normalize.</li>
 *   <li>{@code TITLE} — the inquiry's subject line. A seller-facing field that is usually the
 *       question itself, without the greeting and the thread.</li>
 *   <li>{@code SUBJECT} — the question's TOPIC-bearing words only: function words and polite endings
 *       ({@link QueryWords}) removed, and — Retrieval Query Selection v1 — the two closed classes a
 *       planner writes removed by {@link QueryTokens}: INSTRUCTION (「확인해줘」, 「명시돼 있는지」,
 *       「가능한」, in any inflection) and META (the nouns for the artefact and the party: 문서·설명·FAQ·
 *       정책·판매자·상품의). At most {@link #SUBJECT_WORDS} such words, from the front. Because the
 *       meta words no longer take a slot, the cap no longer drops 조건 to keep 문서.</li>
 *   <li>{@code FULL} — the title and the head of the body as one string, bounded to
 *       {@link #FULL_CHARS}. The form the retriever was always given; kept last so a short question the
 *       subject rule over-trimmed is still asked whole.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Identical texts collapse, blanks are skipped, and there are never more than four. Every candidate
 * goes through the unchanged gates; a candidate cannot lower a threshold, only phrase the question
 * the way the corpus could have been written about.
 *
 * <p>No model is asked for keywords and no morphological service is called: {@link QueryTokens} is
 * two reviewable lists and one closed grammar, like {@code QueryWords.FUNCTION} beside it. A planner's
 * sentence and the seller's own about the same document therefore reduce to the same SUBJECT — the
 * candidate-agreement property the tests pin — and a structured topic the caller already holds
 * ({@code TOPIC}) is tried before any free-text form.
