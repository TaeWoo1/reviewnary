/**
 * Customer Operations Memory — what this company has actually answered before.
 *
 * <p><b>Two lanes, the same three acts</b> (Review Delivery Truth Spine v1). {@code
 * InquiryAnswerMemoryHook} writes the inquiry lane's approval and verified send; {@code
 * com.sellerops.review.memory.ReviewAnswerMemoryHook} writes the review lane's, and
 * {@code origin_review_id} is which. The acts and their strengths are identical because they are the
 * same acts — a seller approving an exact version, and a channel read-back proving that version is
 * what the customer received. What differs is only how much can be proven: a review reply reaches
 * {@code EXECUTOR_SENT_VERIFIED} on the API lane alone, because the guided lane has no read-back that
 * can compare a body.
 *
 * <p><b>Only the seller's own acts get in.</b> {@link #remember} is called for those acts and no
 * others: a collected marketplace answer, an approval, and a verified send. Nothing writes an AI
 * draft here, and nothing writes a draft a person was still editing. That is the whole safety
 * property of this class — a memory that accepted unapproved model output would be a model reading
 * its own guesses back as precedent, and the drift would be invisible because every citation would
 * still look like "판매자의 과거 답변".
 *
 * <p><b>It never writes a policy.</b> A remembered answer can disagree with the company's written
 * operating rule, and when it does the rule is not edited and not overruled — both are offered, each
 * with its own provenance, and the person decides. Automatic promotion of "what we said last time"
 * into "what we do" is how an exception becomes a policy nobody chose.
 *
 * <p><b>The same retrieval as everything else.</b> {@link KnowledgeRetriever}, the same thresholds,
 * the same absence gate. A past answer that does not cover the question is not offered, exactly as a
 * product note that does not cover it is not offered.
