 * the words of the question that the seller's own writing also uses, digits removed
 * ({@code TopicSignature}). The body is the SELLER's text, which is the half of the exchange this
 * company authored and is about to author again.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #originRef} is the identity.</b> One collected answer, one approval, one verified
