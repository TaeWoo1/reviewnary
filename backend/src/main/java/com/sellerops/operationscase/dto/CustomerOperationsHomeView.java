/**
 * 「고객 운영 관리」 on the Operations Home: the responsibility's own state and its three exception areas.
 *
 * <p><b>Three populations, never added.</b> {@code decisions} counts open customer cases waiting for the seller
 * (and still waiting on the canonical record); {@code handled} counts what Reviewnary closed or is watching; {@code gaps}
 * counts sources the seller has to fix. {@code sources} is the latest finished run's observation facts — a source
 * with {@code completeness = NONE} carries {@code observedCount = null}, which is «could not observe», never 0.
 *
 * <p>{@code available = false}: this deployment does not run the job for this organisation; the screen draws nothing.
