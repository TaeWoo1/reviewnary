/**
 * <b>Canonical truth wins.</b> Re-derives every open OperationsCase from the record that owns the work, and is the
 * only writer of an open case's status.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An inquiry case follows its work item and the inquiry: a work item past waiting-for-seller is the seller
 *   having acted (which phase it reached is on the work item's own audit — this never says «sent» or «verified» in
 *   a word of its own; where an execution exists, the answer lifecycle's own tokens are quoted into the event); an
 *   excluded or answered inquiry closes the case.</li>
 *   <li>A review case follows the review: a reply on the channel or a seller triage decision after the case opened is
 *   the seller acting; a watched review stops being watched after {@link #MONITORING_WINDOW}. Since Review
 *   Delivery Truth Spine v1 the reply lane's own record counts as a third — an approved reply reviewnary executed,
 *   or one the seller reported submitting — with that lane's tokens quoted into the event exactly as the inquiry
 *   lane's are, and without writing {@code review.replyState}, which only ingestion may write.</li>
 *   <li>A gap case closes only when the source is READ completely again — that is decided by the run that reads it,
 *   not here — or when its account is gone.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here calls a channel, a model, or an approval. It reads rows other code wrote.
