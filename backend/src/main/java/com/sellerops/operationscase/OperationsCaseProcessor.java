 *   before this run considers anything new, so the run cannot re-raise work it would have retired.</li>
 *   <li><b>Gaps.</b> A source the seller must reconnect before Reviewnary can read it becomes ONE open case per
 *   account; the same failure in a later run updates that case; a complete read closes it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Discover.</b> Rows this responsibility is responsible for — those that arrived after it first read the
 *   source completely — whose customer-side state has not been processed yet. An unchanged row matches an existing
 *   signature and writes nothing. A changed row with an open case updates that case; it never opens a second.</li>
 *   <li><b>Decide.</b> The rules settle what is obvious. Only what they cannot settle is investigated, and only up to
 *   {@code max-per-run}; the rest stay candidates for the next run (nothing is written for them).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Restart-safe without a ledger of its own.</b> Every step re-reads the database, every write is idempotent
 * (signature unique, one open case per subject), and a reclaimed attempt simply calls this again.

    /**
     * <b>What a 확인 필요 review already knows, before any model runs.</b>
     *
     * <p>Until this, a review reached 「내 결정 필요」 with {@code recommendedAction} null and stood in the queue
     * beside an inquiry that said 「제안: 답변 확인 후 발송 · 초안 있음」, carrying nothing but the line that says it is
     * a low-rated review. That was not a missing capability — the investigation is default-OFF and INQUIRY-shaped,
     * but the <em>deterministic</em> review preparation has existed and shipped in the proactive lane all along.
     * So the case reuses it rather than reaching its own conclusion: see {@link #setReviewInvestigator}.
     *
     * <p><b>Costs no model call and no marketplace call</b> — it counts rows in the issue memory. That is the whole
     * reason it may run for every review that needs a decision: there is no per-review spend to ration, so no review
     * has to be chosen over another, and nothing is bought for a review the rules already closed or put under watch.
     *
     * <p>Three fields, each earned by a fact this lane holds:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code recommendedAction} — the investigator's own sentence, carried whole. It already leads with the
     *       repetition it found ({@code 「…」 문제가 N건 확인됐습니다}), so the evidence and the suggestion are one
     *       statement rather than two that could disagree.</li>
     *   <li>{@code evidenceCount} — 1 when the issue memory answered, 0 when it had nothing. A product with no issue
     *       memory yields no repeat claim rather than a hedged one.</li>
     *   <li>{@code preparedAction} — {@code RECOMMENDATION_ONLY}, which is the ceiling for a review and the honest
     *       name for what now exists: something to read, and nothing to send.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>{@code recommendedActionType} is deliberately left null.</b> The investigator names a next step in the
     * seller's language; it does not choose from this repository's eight-value action vocabulary, and picking one
     * here would be this method inventing the judgement the brief said to reuse. A later investigation may fill it —
     * {@code applyInvestigation} overwrites all of this, as it should: a model that actually read the review outranks
     * a row count.
     *
     * <p>{@code summary} is left alone for the same reason. It is where the investigation puts what it concluded,
     * and duplicating the recommendation's first clause into it would show the seller one fact twice.

     *   <li><b>It cannot contradict a rule.</b> A case the rating settled ({@code AUTO_RESOLVED} /
     *   {@code MONITORING}) returned from {@link #handle} before this line. Only work the rule could not settle
     *   is offered to the overlay.</li>
     *   <li><b>It cannot weaken a fence.</b> The disposition stays {@code NEEDS_DECISION} and the authority stays
     *   {@code HUMAN} — both were set above and neither is written here. {@code OperationsPolicyFence} refuses an
     *   AUTO action at write time, so there is no stored policy whose action could want them lowered, and this
     *   method does not have the code to lower them if there were. It closes nothing, approves nothing, mints
     *   nothing and sends nothing.</li>
     *   <li><b>It changes handling only.</b> One field: {@code recommendedActionType}. The triage tier, the
     *   queue's ordering, {@code review.reply_state} and the {@code KnowledgeAuthority} ranks are not reachable
     *   from here — this class has no caller for any of them.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>{@code decidedBy} becomes {@code SELLER}</b>, which is what V129 added the third value for: a case

     * {@code POLICY_APPLIED} event carries the policy id, its revision, its scope and the problem key it matched,
     * so «왜 이렇게 추천됐나» is answerable a year later even after the rule has been revised twice.
     *
     * <p><b>No evidence count, no confidence, no draft.</b> The seller's rule is not an investigation and must not

     * <b>Take a subject over from the legacy proactive lane — one open card per subject, and this one is ours.</b>
     *
     * <p>Both producers write {@code proactive_case} and {@code uq_proactive_case_open_subject} spans both of them:
     * one {@code PREPARED} row per {@code (org, subject_kind, subject_id)}, whichever lane wrote it. The two are
     * blind to each other by construction — {@code @SQLRestriction} shows each only its own rows, and the signature
     * namespaces are disjoint (the operations lane prefixes {@code rr:}) — so each looks for a stale open card,
     * finds nothing, and they meet at the database instead.
     *
     * <p>That collision used to be swallowed as {@code blocked} and the operations case was simply never written.
     * It could not resolve itself: {@code ProactiveScheduler} drops a delegated organisation from its tick
     * entirely, so no loop could ever close the squatter. <b>A single stale legacy card starved its subject
     * forever</b>, and the subject that lost was always the one a responsibility had been made responsible for.
     *
     * <p>So ownership is stated rather than raced for. Where a {@code CUSTOMER_OPERATIONS_V1} responsibility is
     * the one deciding this subject, its case is canonical and the legacy annotation stands down.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Closed, never deleted.</b> The row keeps its reason, its investigation and its dates and gains
     *       {@link ProactiveCloseReason#DELEGATED_TO_RESPONSIBILITY} — the enum's own rule is that a card which
     *       vanished has to be able to say why. Nothing is rewritten and no history is dropped.</li>
     *   <li><b>Per subject, not per organisation.</b> Only a subject this lane is deciding right now changes
     *       hands. Legacy cards for subjects outside this responsibility's reach keep standing, because closing
     *       them would take a card away and put nothing in its place — the brief is that the operations case is
     *       canonical for the subjects it manages, not that the legacy lane is over.</li>
     *   <li><b>That is also what keeps one subject in one list.</b> After the handover the subject has exactly one
     *       live annotation; before it, exactly one. There is no moment where both lanes describe it.</li>
     *   <li><b>{@code saveAndFlush}</b>, because the insert below needs the index slot actually free, not merely
     *       free in the persistence context.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The catch around that insert stays where it is. It was written for a genuine race and that is now all it
     * can be — but a fence that has stopped being reachable is not one to remove.

     *
     * <p>It is the same seam, called with the same argument: {@link CaseDraftPreparer}, the production proposal
     * transition, {@link com.sellerops.inquiry.draft.InquiryDraftComposer}, and {@link #recordPrepared} deciding
     * what the outcome means for the case. No second draft path, and nothing new to keep in step.

     * <h2>Why the capability is asked BEFORE the preparer</h2>
     *
     * <p>Because a deployment with drafting off must pay exactly what it paid before, and
     * {@link CaseDraftPreparer#prepare} is not free on the way to being declined: it proposes — a row, an audit and
     * an OPEN → PROPOSED transition — and then runs a full retrieval, only for the composer to report the switch is
     * off. Asking first keeps a switched-off deployment byte-identical to the one before this method existed.
     *
     * <p>{@code REPLY_TO_CUSTOMER} is the whole resolution test. It is reachable from exactly the two terminals
     * that mean the question is answerable — {@code RESOLVED} and {@code RESOLVED_CONDITIONAL}
     * ({@link CaseFromResolution}) — and only ever alongside {@code NEEDS_DECISION}, so no separate state check
     * says anything the action does not already say.
