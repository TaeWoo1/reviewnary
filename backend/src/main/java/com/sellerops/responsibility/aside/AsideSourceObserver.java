/**
 * <b>One scheduled observation carried by an installed helper instead of by a channel's API.</b>
 *
 * <p>The shape deliberately mirrors {@code ResponsibilitySourceObserver}: hand out the work, wait a bounded
 * time, and return a {@link SourceObservation} that states its own completeness. What changes is who does the
 * reading — a browser on the seller's desk, driven by a published recipe, against a surface this repository
 * serves itself.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule this class exists to keep.</b> A helper that is asleep, offline, unlinked or simply never
 * answered has told us <em>nothing</em>, and nothing is not zero. Every such path returns {@link
 * SourceCompleteness#NONE} with a reason and no count — which the observation record enforces in its
 * constructor and the schema enforces again in SQL. «확인하지 못함» and «0건» stay different rows.
 *
 * <p><b>How «nothing changed» is known without keeping what was on the page.</b> The helper reports a digest of
 * the surface's own item refs — ids this repository published to itself. Same digest as the previous settled
 * observation ⇒ nothing new; different ⇒ the counts say by how much. No customer text, no page content and no
 * marketplace data is involved at any point, because the surface has none.
 *
 * <p><b>PILOT_ACCEPTED_LIMITATION — this wait blocks the run thread.</b> {@code aside.wait-seconds} (default 120)
 * is spent inside the run, exactly as {@code adopt-wait-seconds} is for a channel collection: the run holds its
 * lease, heartbeats, and does nothing else meanwhile. For the first pilot that is accepted rather than designed
 * away — one organisation, one device, one recipe, and a bound that is an order of magnitude under the lease.
 * It is written down because it is a real cost, not because it is hidden: a deployment running many
 * organisations would feel it, and the answer then is an asynchronous hand-off (the job row already survives a
 * restart and is claimable by id), NOT a longer wait. Do not rebuild that until a pilot measurement asks for it.
