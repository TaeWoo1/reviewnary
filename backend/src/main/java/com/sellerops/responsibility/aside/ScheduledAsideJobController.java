/**
 * <b>The two things an installed helper may say when nobody is watching: «anything for me?» and «here is what
 * it came to».</b>
 *
 * <p>The helper names neither the organisation nor itself. Both are taken from the device token the auth filter
 * already validated — the org from the principal, the device from the attribute that filter set — so a request
 * body cannot point this at another seller's device, and there is no parameter through which it could try.
 *
 * <p>There is also no parameter for what to run. The job's recipe is an allow-listed enum chosen when the job
 * was queued; the response tells the helper which recipe, and the helper resolves that name to a surface this
 * repository serves on its own loopback. A marketplace is unreachable from here because no field in either
 * direction can express one.

     * period it cannot express as an offset from its own as-of day — and then proves, from the screen's own
     * period controls, that the list really is showing those days before it reads a row.
