 *

 * {@link #channelCode()} reads a surface this repository serves itself; one that names a channel points the
 * seller's own authenticated browser at a real marketplace. The second kind is gated separately
 * ({@link AsideMarketplaceAccess}) — off unless a deployment names the organisation AND the seller account —
 * and can still only do what its bound workflow does: one published route, one page, no click.

     *   row's detail link opens ({@code openReviewDetailModal(id)}, 15/15 rendered rows) — the same id the
     *   guided reply lane matched against the exported 리뷰글번호 live on 2026-09-03 and 09-05. The DOM
     *   {@code row-id} is the grid's index and is NOT used.</li>
     *   <li><b>a store fence the backend can judge.</b> Every product number on the page (11/11) is in this
     *   organisation's NAVER catalogue, collected by the official API with this account's own credential, and
     *   in no other organisation's. 채널상품번호 is NAVER-global, so a page of another store's reviews cannot pass.
     *   The comparison runs on the backend; the helper is never handed the catalogue.</li>
     *   <li><b>truthful coverage.</b> The screen's default period (7 days) is the bound. A run never claims the
     *   store's whole review history — its source row is {@code BOUNDED}, never {@code COMPLETE}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>No click, no keystroke, no scroll, no download, no export, no reply and no model call. The buyer's id,

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>the same source id the official API uses.</b> The screen (AngularJS, {@code #/comment/}) keeps its rows
     *   on the view controller, and each row's {@code id} is the Commerce API's {@code questionId}: on 7/7 inquiries
