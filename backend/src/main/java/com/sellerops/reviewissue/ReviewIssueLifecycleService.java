/**
 * Moves issues through {@link IssueLifecycleState}, and refuses transitions that are not the
 * lifecycle's.
 *
 * <p><b>Only two transitions are automatic</b> — OBSERVING → NEEDS_REVIEW when a judgement fires,
 * and VERIFYING → RESOLVED after enough quiet weeks (plus RESOLVED → OBSERVING on new evidence,
 * performed by {@link ReviewIssueExtractionService} where the fact is visible). Everything else
 * requires a person, because SellerOps cannot know that work was done.
 *
 * <p><b>Why RESOLVED is unreachable from anywhere but VERIFYING.</b> An issue that simply went quiet
 * without recorded remediation may be seeing slow sales, seasonality, or a missed import — none of
 * which is a fix. Auto-resolving it would turn a coverage gap into a success report. There is
 * deliberately no operator "mark resolved" either: the operator's contribution is recording that
 * they acted, and the quiet period is then evidence rather than assertion.
