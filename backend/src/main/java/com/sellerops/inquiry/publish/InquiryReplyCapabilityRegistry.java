/**
 * What is known — from this repository and from audited vendor contracts — about posting a reply to
 * each channel's inquiries. A narrow, code-level registry, in the manner of {@code
 * ChannelApiGapRegistry}: it moves no capability status in
 * {@code docs/multi-channel-connector-roadmap.md} §4.1 and opens no schedule. It exists so a screen
 * can say the precise thing instead of inferring "unsupported" from the absence of an adapter.
 *
 * <p><b>Every row cites what it was derived from, and nothing is guessed.</b> A row is
 * {@link InquiryReplyTransport#DIRECT_API} only when an implemented endpoint exists in this
 * repository — not when a vendor's documentation is believed to describe one. A channel nobody has
 * audited is {@link InquiryReplyTransport#NEEDS_VERIFICATION}, which is a statement about the audit,
 * not about the channel.
 *
 * <p><b>NAVER is split by source subtype</b> because the two are different resources with different
 * identifier spaces ({@code questionId} vs {@code inquiryNo}) and would need different endpoints. An
 * approval for one is not an approval for the other, which is why the subtype is bound into the
 * approval and re-checked before the send.

     * The audit, as of Inquiry Action Flow v1 (2026-08-24).
     *
     * <p>COUPANG is the only DIRECT_API, and it is one because the endpoint is implemented here
     * ({@code CoupangInquiryReplyClient} → {@code POST .../onlineInquiries/{inquiryId}/replies}) with
     * an adapter that resolves the target from the {@code onlineInquiry:} handle stored at collection
     * time. It has never been exercised against a real marketplace; "implemented" and "live-proven"
     * are different claims and only the first is made here.
     *
     * <p><b>Both NAVER subtypes are DIRECT_API as of Inquiry Workflow Completion v2 (2026-08-24),
     * and they are two rows because they are two contracts.</b> The official per-endpoint documents
     * are vendored here — {@code docs/vendor/naver-commerce-api/put-v1-contents-qnas-questionId.md}
     * and {@code post-v1-pay-merchant-inquiries-inquiryNo-answer.md} — and what they show is exactly
     * why "a generic NAVER write" would have been a fiction:
     *
     * <table>
     *   <caption>The two answer contracts, side by side</caption>
     *   <tr><th></th><th>상품 문의</th><th>고객 문의</th></tr>
     *   <tr><td>call</td><td>{@code PUT /v1/contents/qnas/&#123;questionId&#125;}</td>
     *       <td>{@code POST /v1/pay-merchant/inquiries/&#123;inquiryNo&#125;/answer}</td></tr>
     *   <tr><td>body</td><td>{@code commentContent}</td><td>{@code answerComment}</td></tr>
     *   <tr><td>target</td><td>{@code questionId} (int64)</td><td>{@code inquiryNo} (int64)</td></tr>
     *   <tr><td>already answered</td><td><b>silently overwrites</b> — the vendor states a second call
     *       "등록이 아닌 수정으로 동작"</td><td><b>refuses</b> with {@code ERR-NC-101010}</td></tr>
     *   <tr><td>errors</td><td>plain 400/401/403/404/500</td><td>{@code ERR-NC-1010xx} inside 400</td></tr>
     * </table>
     *
     * <p>The identifier spaces do not overlap and both are bare int64s, so an approval for one spent
     * on the other would not fail — it would answer a different customer's question. That is the
     * reason the subtype is bound into the approval and re-checked before the send, and the reason
     * each adapter names its own subtype in {@code servesSubtype}.
     *
     * <p><b>The connector's read-only fence is untouched.</b> The answer clients live in
     * {@code inquiry/publish/naver}, not in {@code connector/naver}, so
     * {@code NaverReadOnlyFenceTest} still holds over the lane that runs on a SCHEDULE with no human
     * in the turn. The write lane is the one that can never run without one.
     *
     * <p><b>CAFE24 moved NEEDS_VERIFICATION → DIRECT_API on 2026-08-25 (Cafe24 Answer Execution v1),
     * and it took two approved READs to earn it</b> — one that proved WHAT an answer is on this board
     * (a child article), and one that proved what a real seller answer CARRIES (43 of 44 under the
     * shop's own member identity, titled exactly as the question, with the answered mark on the
     * parent). The endpoint is implemented here and has never been exercised against a real mall, so
     * the row says implemented and not live-proven — and, unlike every other DIRECT_API row, it names
     * three preconditions that must each be true before a send: the seller's own
     * {@code mall.write_community} grant, a configured {@code client_ip}, and an armed live-run
     * approval id. See the re-audit below.
     *
     * <p><b>Re-audited 2026-08-24 (Inquiry Workflow Completion v2).</b>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>NAVER</b> — moved PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_NOT_IMPLEMENTED → DIRECT_API for both subtypes,
     *       on the strength of the vendored request contracts above and the adapters written against
     *       them. Implemented is still not live-proven: neither has ever been exercised against a
     *       real store, and no NAVER answer can leave the process without an armed live-run approval
     *       id ({@code NaverAnswerLiveGuard}).</li>
     *   <li><b>CAFE24</b> — as of 2026-08-25 both sides are audited: the platform's representation is
     *       CONFIRMED and SellerOps implements it. What remains unproven is not the path but one of
     *       its effects (below), and three runtime preconditions that are deliberately not defaulted.
     *
     *       <p><b>Re-retrieved and corrected 2026-08-25 (Inquiry Answer Execution v1).</b> The
     *       previous audit named ONE candidate write path — the comment POST — and reported that no
     *       contracted way existed to mark an existing article answered, because
     *       {@code PUT /articles/&#123;article_no&#125;} does not accept {@code reply_status}. The
     *       {@code PUT} observation was re-confirmed against both the English and Korean references.
     *       <b>The inference drawn from it was wrong.</b> The same resource's {@code POST} accepts
     *       {@code reply_article_no} — "If you want to add an reply to a post, enter the number of
     *       the post" — and carries {@code reply_status} and {@code reply_user_id} on that same call.
     *       On a Cafe24 board an ANSWER is itself an ARTICLE ({@code parent_article_no},
     *       {@code reply_sequence}, {@code reply_depth}), which is why no field in the article
     *       property list holds an answer's text. Separately, the reference publishes an
     *       {@code urgentinquiry} resource whose reply
     *       ({@code GET/POST/PUT /urgentinquiry/&#123;article_no&#125;/reply}) is the ONLY object in
     *       the whole Admin reference that carries an answer's {@code content}.
     *
     *       <p>So there are three candidates, not one, and the reference states which one board 6
     *       uses for none of them:
     *       <ul>
     *         <li><b>A1</b> reply ARTICLE — {@code POST /boards/&#123;board_no&#125;/articles} with
     *             {@code reply_article_no}; requires {@code writer} + {@code client_ip}.</li>
     *         <li><b>A2</b> comment — {@code POST /articles/&#123;article_no&#125;/comments};
     *             requires {@code writer} + {@code password}.</li>
     *         <li><b>B</b> urgentinquiry reply — {@code POST /urgentinquiry/&#123;article_no&#125;/reply};
     *             requires {@code user_id}, and needs no writer, password or client_ip.</li>
     *       </ul>
     *
     *       <p>Two things still block all three, and neither is a decision waiting to be made:
     *       <ol>
     *         <li>Which representation this mall's board 6 actually uses is unproven. It is
     *             answerable by READ alone — 43 board-6 articles in the canonical Demo Org already
     *             carry {@code reply_status=C}, so the seller's own past answers are on the platform
     *             to be observed, and no unanswered customer inquiry need be touched. The bounded
     *             READ manifest is {@code docs/inquiry_answer_execution_v1.md} §7 and it stops in
     *             front of approval.</li>
     *         <li>The actor values differ per path and SellerOps holds none of them: the stored
     *             Cafe24 connection is exactly {@code mall_id} + {@code refresh_token}
     *             ({@code CredentialTemplates}). Hardcoding them is forbidden and inventing them
     *             would put a fabricated author on a customer-visible reply. One documented exit
     *             exists: {@code member_id} equal to {@code mall_id} makes the author render as the
     *             shop's name rather than a person's.</li>
     *       </ol>
     *       The connection's own grant is a third, independent fact:
     *       {@code mall.read_community,mall.read_order,mall.read_product} — read-only. And it cannot
     *       currently be widened even deliberately: {@code Cafe24OnboardingService} throws at
     *       construction if the configured scope string contains {@code write}.</li>
     *   <li><b>COUPANG · GMARKET</b> — unchanged: implemented, never live-proven.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Two of these rows have since been live-proven, and the evidence strings say so.</b> They
     * are not comments: {@code evidence} is carried on {@link InquiryReplyCapabilityView} and reaches
     * the frontend through {@code PublishCapabilityController.transports()}, so "구현됨, 라이브 미실행"
