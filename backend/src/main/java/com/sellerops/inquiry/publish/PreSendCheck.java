/**
 * The answer to "may this exact approval be spent, right now, on this exact target?" — evaluated
 * immediately before the only marketplace WRITE in the product.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a re-check exists at all.</b> An approval is a statement about a moment: the seller read
 * this draft, for this inquiry, on this account. Time passes between that moment and the dispatch —
 * a resume after a restart can put hours in between — and everything the statement referred to can
 * move. The confirm already proved the TEXT is the one that was read; this proves the TARGET is the
 * one that was agreed to, and that it is still answerable.
 *
 * <p><b>Two different negatives, kept apart.</b> {@link #refused} means a fact contradicts the
 * approval — a different account, a different inquiry handle, a different source resource, or an
 * inquiry that already carries an answer. Nothing is sent. {@link #stateProven} being false means
 * something could not be checked: the channel's own collection is not currently fresh, so "still
 * unanswered" is the last thing SellerOps saw rather than the thing that is true now. That is not a
 * refusal — a quiet channel would otherwise make the feature unusable — but it is never silence
 * either: it is recorded on the execution row and shown on the confirm screen before the press, so
 * the human who accepts the risk is the human who was told about it.
 *
 * @param refused     true when a fact contradicts the approval — do not dispatch
 * @param reason      closed-vocabulary reason; null when nothing is wrong
 * @param stateProven whether the target's answerability was proven by a currently-fresh collection
 * @param note        closed-vocabulary reason the state could not be proven; null when it was
