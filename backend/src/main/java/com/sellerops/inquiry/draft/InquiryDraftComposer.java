/**
 * Inquiry Draft v1 — write a reply the seller can send, from what SellerOps can actually prove.
 *
 * <p><b>The order of evidence is the product.</b> The customer's question, then the canonical product
 * it is about, then the seller's own knowledge about that product. Nothing else is consulted, and
 * nothing that is not consulted is cited. When the knowledge is thin the draft is still written — a
 * seller with an empty library is not helped by a refusal — but it is written from the question alone
 * and the screen says so, in one sentence, above the text
 * ({@link DraftKnowledgeState#messageKo()}).
 *
 * <p><b>Two provenances that must not be confused.</b> A passage retrieved from 상품 지식 is something
 * a person at this company typed; a product FACT (brand, category, listing title) is something a
 * marketplace told us. They are different claims with different failure modes, and this class emits
 * only the first kind of evidence. The agent runtime keeps the same separation
 * ({@code PRODUCT_KNOWLEDGE_DOC} vs {@code PRODUCT_FACT}).
 *
 * <p><b>It writes a draft and nothing else.</b> No approval, no intent, no execution. The result is
 * one more append-only version on the work item — the same object a seller who typed it by hand would
 * have produced, distinguishable only by the provenance stamped on it.
 *
 * <p><b>One bounded marketplace READ can happen here, and it is new.</b> Before writing, this asks
 * {@link ProductDetailEnrichmentTrigger} whether the bound product's 상세페이지 has ever been read;
 * if not, one listing is read and indexed. That is the "actionable inquiry + exact attribution +
 * missing knowledge" trigger, and it is the only reason a draft touches a channel besides the order
 * fact. It cannot fail the draft: every outcome of that call is swallowed and reported.
 *
 * <p><b>"No basis" and "did not run" are different answers</b> (product-owner, 2026-08-27).
 * {@link AnswerBasisState} is a statement about EVIDENCE. A spent budget, a capability that is off,
 * a vendor that did not answer, and a 상세페이지 read that failed are statements about the MACHINERY,
 * and reporting them as {@code NO_ANSWER_BASIS} told a seller to go write knowledge they already
 * had. They travel in {@code unavailableMessage} instead — and when a detail read failed, the basis
 * verdict is still reported but must not be the sentence on screen: we did not finish looking, so
 * "there is nothing to find" is not ours to say.
 *
 * <p><b>When there is no basis, nothing is written</b> (product-owner, 2026-08-26).
 * {@link AnswerBasisState#NO_ANSWER_BASIS} means no current evidence applies, and in that state no
 * model is called and no version is saved. The deterministic drafter that used to fill the gap is
 * gone with it: its output was 「확인한 뒤 정확한 안내를 드리겠습니다」 — a promise SellerOps made on
 * the seller's behalf with nothing behind it, in exactly the state where nothing is behind it. A
 * seller-approved fallback belongs to Organization Answer Style, which does not exist yet, and until
 * it does the honest screen is one that says what is missing.
