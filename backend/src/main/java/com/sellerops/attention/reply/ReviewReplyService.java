/**
 * Review response preparation: read the review, start from a suggested reply, edit it, approve
 * it, copy it. The operator pastes it into the seller center themselves.
 *
 * <p><b>What this is not.</b> There is no marketplace write path behind any of it — no
 * adapter, no action intent, no dispatcher, no verification. The reply leaves SellerOps
 * through the clipboard and nowhere else. Approving freezes text; it does not send it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code RESPONSE_NEEDED} still promises nothing.</b> It gates whether preparation is
 * OFFERED; it never causes it. Nothing here runs when a disposition is recorded — an operator
 * opens this surface explicitly, or it never opens. {@code TriageDisposition}'s "recording
 * RESPONSE_NEEDED does not draft, queue, send, or promise a reply" is still literally true, and
 * keeping it true is a requirement rather than a coincidence.
 *
 * <p><b>This class owns authorization, the gate, and the capability rule</b>, and delegates
 * persistence to {@link ReviewReplyDraftService} and {@link ReviewReplyApprovalService}. Those
 * two assume both checks have run; nothing else is wired to them. Stating the rule once is what
 * keeps the read, the save, and the approval from drifting into three different opinions about
 * what is allowed.
 *
 * <p><b>Authorization is re-derived from the principal on every call</b>, exactly as
 * {@code ReviewTriageService} does, and the ref is never trusted for any of it: org from the
 * JWT, account must exist in that org, review must exist in that org, review's channel must be
 * the account's channel. Steps 2–4 all fail as 404 — non-disclosure, so a caller cannot tell
 * "no such review" from "someone else's" from "yours, wrong account".
 *
 * <p>Carries no {@code @Transactional}, and must not gain one — see
 * {@link ReviewReplyApprovalWriter}.
