/**
 * One thing a seller did about a derived opportunity — the closed vocabulary of
 * {@code improvement_opportunity_event.event}.
 *
 * <p><b>These are decisions, not outcomes.</b> None of them says the problem changed, that anything
 * was sent, or that the action worked. {@code ACCEPTED} means «prepare this»; it does not mean the
 * FAQ was written. What happened to the problem itself is the issue lifecycle's to say, and this
 * vocabulary deliberately has no word that could be mistaken for it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code APPLIED} is on the decision side of that line, and it took some care to keep it there.</b> It
 * says the seller wrote the FAQ — an act, dated, with the artifact named where there is one. It says nothing
 * about whether complaints fell, and it cannot: that answer does not exist for another four weeks, and when it
 * does it is an {@code ImprovementOutcome} and not an event here.
 *
 * <p>{@code EDITED} is the odd one: it leaves the status where it was. It is here because the seller
 * rewriting the prepared text is a thing they did, and a trail that recorded only status changes
 * would say a draft was «준비됨» on a date and never that the seller made it theirs.
