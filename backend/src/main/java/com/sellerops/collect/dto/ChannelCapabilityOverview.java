/**
 * Operator-facing capability read model for a channel, combining the in-code
 * connector capabilities (the source of truth for API connectors, which are not
 * all seeded into {@code connector_capabilities}) with the connector's honest
 * unsupported-scope boundaries. Channel-generic by design: every API channel
 * answers the same shape, so the UI renders one component for all of them.
 *
 * <p>{@code connectorClass} and each data type's {@code supported}/{@code verificationStatus}
 * reflect the connector actually wired for the channel (e.g. CAFE24 → the Cafe24 connector when its
 * feature flag is on), so the badges never claim more than that connector can serve.
 *
 * <p><b>Two fields deliberately outlive the connector</b>, because the facts they carry are about
 * the CHANNEL and stay true whichever connector answered — both keyed by channel, neither derived
 * from {@code supported}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code dataTypes[].acquisitionPaths}, from {@code AcquisitionPathRegistry} — how SellerOps
 *       really collects a type when that is not through the connector.
 *   <li>{@code unsupportedScopes}, which merges the connector's own boundaries with the channel-level
 *       gaps in {@code ChannelApiGapRegistry} — what the marketplace never offered.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>They are the two halves of one answer, and both have to survive a flagged-off connector. The
 * first arrived without the second, and the badge overclaimed for exactly as long as that lasted.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code backgroundDataTypes} (Product Self-Knowledge Truth Closure v1).</b> The knowledge-layer
 * types — today PRODUCT — computed from the same live connector as {@code dataTypes} but kept in their
 * own list rather than appended to it. The operator badge row is the seller-visible contract of
 * {@code dataTypes} and widening it would change a screen nobody asked to change; the Agent's product
 * truth needs the fact regardless, because PRODUCT is one of the four operating objects and had no
 * per-channel answer anywhere. SALES is deliberately absent: it is not an operating object.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code dataTypes[].declaredSupport} / {@code declaredVerificationStatus}.</b> What the
 * {@code connector_capabilities} reference table says, beside what the live connector says —
 * {@code SUPPORTED} / {@code UNSUPPORTED} / {@code UNDECLARED}, and the table's own verification word.
 * Both are carried, never folded in: the two sources genuinely disagree today, and they disagree on
 * BOTH axes. Coupang PRODUCT is {@code CONFIRMED} in the table and {@code NEEDS_VERIFICATION} in the
 * connector; Coupang INQUIRY is the other way round; NAVER SALES is {@code CONFIRMED} in the table and
 * not served at all by the connector. A reader that silently picked the stronger of two disagreeing
 * sources would state a capability nobody proved. Whoever reads this pair must go the conservative way.
