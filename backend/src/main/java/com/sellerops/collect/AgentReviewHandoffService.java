/**
 * **The binding and the mapping, and nothing else.** It resolves the opaque account slot inside the caller's
 * org, guards the channel, turns each acquired row into the canonical review record every other source already
 * produces, and hands the batch to {@link IngestionService} — the one place that knows how a review is deduped
 * and stored.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately no second dedup rule here. The screen carries no per-review identifier
 * ({@code docs/coupang_review_policy_gate_v1.md} §9.2), so these rows arrive with {@code externalId = null} and
 * fall to the ingestion spine's content hash — which is the fallback it has always had, reached for the reason
 * it exists rather than a Coupang special case. What Coupang changes is only the FORMULA version
 * ({@code ReviewDedupKey.versionFor} → v2, folding rating), and that lives with the other formulas.
 *
 * <p><b>The buyer never arrives.</b> The request record has no author field and rejects unknown properties, the
 * canonical record has none, and the reviews table has no column for one. Three layers, none of which is a
 * filter — a filter is a thing that can be forgotten.
 *
 * <p><b>The review names its product with an id this service does not pass on.</b> Coupang's 상품평 screen
 * prints 노출상품ID, which is neither the 등록상품ID the catalogue is keyed by nor the 옵션ID a variant
 * carries. Sent through as a SKU it matched nothing and the ingestion spine built a second product
 * beside the real one — up to one per listing. So the display id is used here as a LOOKUP KEY into the
 * listings this org has actually read, and what travels on is the SKU of the product that listing
 * already belongs to. Nothing the agent sends is trusted as a canonical identity, and this path can no
 * longer create a product at all: an unresolved review is a counted failure, never a new row.
 *
 * <p><b>Reply state is UNKNOWN, permanently.</b> Coupang gives sellers no way to answer a 상품평, so there is no
 * channel statement to preserve and none is fabricated. A review that cannot be replied to is not "unanswered".

     * 옵션ID first, 노출상품ID second → the SKU of the ONE product the review names, or null.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the order changed (2026-08-23).</b> The display id led for one sitting and placed 12 of 23
     * rows. The diagnosis behind the other 10 came back the opposite of expected: <b>10 of 10 already had a
     * variant in this catalogue</b> under their 옵션ID. Nothing was missing — the 노출상품ID had moved.
     * Coupang may change a {@code productId} by merging or splitting an exposure page, so a 상품평 carries
     * the id it was WRITTEN under while the listing carries the one the API states TODAY, and a column that
     * holds one value cannot hold both. The 옵션ID has no such property: it is the per-option key and it does
     * not move. So it leads, and the display id is what answers when the screen printed no option.
     *
     * <p>The contract, in order, and every step fails closed:
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>옵션ID, scoped to this org and this channel.</b> Exactly one variant ⇒ that variant's product.
     *       Zero ⇒ fall through to the display id, which is a real case: a review older than the catalogue
     *       read, or an option since removed. More than one ⇒ {@link #REASON_AMBIGUOUS_OPTION}, refused.</li>
     *   <li>the display id selects candidate listings — org- and channel-scoped, {@code RealDataOnly}-filtered;</li>
     *   <li>one candidate product ⇒ resolved;</li>
     *   <li>several listings for the SAME product ⇒ still one answer, resolved;</li>
     *   <li>several DIFFERENT products ⇒ the 옵션ID breaks the tie <b>inside</b> that candidate set;</li>
     *   <li>exactly one variant match ⇒ resolved; zero, several, or no 옵션ID at all ⇒ refused;</li>
     *   <li>and the SKU that leaves here must resolve back to the very product chosen, or nothing does.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><b>The scope is org + channel, and that is the finest grain the catalogue has.</b> Neither
     * {@code product_variants} nor {@code channel_products} carries a seller-account column, so an org with
     * two Coupang accounts would have them share this lookup. Stated rather than implied: the account
     * dimension is absent from the catalogue schema, and narrowing to it is a change to that schema, not to
     * this method.
     *
     * <p>The last step is what keeps a wrong id out of the dedup hash. The ingestion spine keys a review on
     * the product it resolves the SKU to, so handing over a SKU that means a different product would write a
     * hash nothing can correct afterwards — the review would be un-findable and would re-store on the next
     * sweep. Cheap to check, and the only way this method can be wrong is if it is not.
     *
     * <p>Nothing here creates a product, a listing, or a variant. Every path returns either a SKU this
     * database already holds or null.
