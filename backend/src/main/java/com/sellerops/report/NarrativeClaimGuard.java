/**
 * The gate between the narrative model and the seller's screen (Agentic Report v1).
 *
 * <p>Two rules, both mechanical, because "be careful" is not auditable:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Trace or drop.</b> A line is kept only if every fact id it cites exists in the snapshot and
 *       it cites at least one. A sentence about nothing in the facts is a sentence the report cannot
 *       stand behind, however reasonable it sounds.</li>
 *   <li><b>No cause, no outcome.</b> A closed list of Korean causal and outcome markers refuses the
 *       line outright. The facts are counts and labels; they do not know why anything happened or what
 *       it did to the business, so a sentence that says 「…때문에」 or 「품질이 나빠졌다」 is asserting
 *       what nothing in its input contains. The list is the same shape as the judge's unsafe-assertion
 *       vocabulary and {@code pages-copy.test.ts}'s outcome guard, applied at the source.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A refused line is not rewritten — deleting the offending clause leaves a sentence nobody chose.
 * It is dropped and counted, and if nothing survives the report shows the deterministic summary.
