/**
 * Drives the account-level connection lifecycle for a NAVER commerce-API seller account — the state
 * machine the guided-connection wizard's success / error / retry screens reflect. Before this,
 * {@code seller_accounts.connection_status} was set to {@link ChannelStatus#PENDING} at registration
 * and never moved for NAVER; this is the missing transition path (Cafe24 has its own
 * {@code Cafe24OnboardingService}).
 *
 * <p>Unlike Cafe24 (one OAuth callback flips CONNECTED), NAVER connects through a <b>two-signal</b>
 * path: an explicit operator credential TEST and a first {@code ORDER_SUMMARY} data sync. CONNECTED
 * is earned only when BOTH are confirmed — neither signal alone is enough — so a green connection
 * honestly means "the operator verified the credential AND order data actually flowed for this
 * seller."
 *
 * <p><b>CONNECTED means "an order sync collected while the credential stood verified."</b> The two
 * signals are ordered by construction: a verified test records PREPARING, and the <em>next</em>
 * collected order sync confirms it. A test never connects by reaching back to a historical sync — a
 * stale sync collected under an old (since-rotated / since-rejected) credential must not vouch for a
 * freshly verified one — so the confirming sync is always one that ran under the verified credential
 * (the guided wizard runs it immediately after a successful test; a schedule provides it otherwise).
 *
 * <p><b>Transitions</b> (all idempotent; a settled CONNECTED account is never shaken by a duplicate
 * success event):
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Explicit test verified</b> — records the verification as {@link ChannelStatus#PREPARING}
 *       ("credential verified, awaiting first order sync"). Never CONNECTED on its own — <b>test alone
 *       never connects</b> — and a reconnect (from RECONNECT_REQUIRED) re-arms here, so it must re-prove
 *       data flow rather than ride a pre-rejection sync.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code ORDER_SUMMARY} sync collected</b> (the caller passes only a run that collected —
 *       SUCCESS or PARTIAL) — only an account already in PREPARING (i.e. the credential was explicitly
 *       verified) advances to CONNECTED. A sync on a not-yet-verified PENDING account changes nothing:
 *       <b>sync alone never connects.</b></li>
 *   <li><b>Credential rejected</b> — a verify outcome <em>clearly classified</em> as an authentication
 *       failure → {@link ChannelStatus#RECONNECT_REQUIRED}. Transient conditions (timeout / network /
 *       5xx / provider-unavailable / an ordinary sync FAILED) never change the status.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Scope + safety.</b> NAVER API accounts only — a call for any other channel or a file-upload
 * account is a no-op (Cafe24 owns its own lifecycle). Each transition re-reads the account under a
 * {@code PESSIMISTIC_WRITE} row lock in its own transaction, so concurrent test / sync events
 * serialize and every transition converges idempotently. It writes only
 * {@code seller_accounts.connection_status}: no credential, secret, timestamp, provider detail, or
 * personal data is read, logged, or returned.
