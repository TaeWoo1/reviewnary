/**
 * The officially documented Coupang WING Open API 상품별 고객문의 collection flow
 * (developers.coupang.com, "Customer Inquiry Query by Product"):
 *
 * <pre>GET /v2/providers/openapi/apis/api/v5/vendors/{vendorId}/onlineInquiries
 *     ?answeredType={ALL|ANSWERED|NOANSWER}&amp;inquiryStartAt={yyyy-MM-dd}&amp;inquiryEndAt={yyyy-MM-dd}
 *     &amp;pageNum={n}&amp;pageSize=50</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Why THIS inquiry endpoint.</b> Coupang exposes two customer-inquiry APIs and they are not
 * interchangeable. This one — the product-page Q&amp;A a buyer posts on a listing — returns
 * <b>no buyer PII whatsoever</b>. The other ({@code callCenterInquiries}, 쿠팡 고객센터 문의)
 * returns {@code buyerEmail} and {@code buyerPhone} and carries transfer/confirm semantics that
 * imply seller obligations SellerOps does not model. It is deliberately NOT called here: a stream
 * that cannot leak buyer PII is better than one that must remember not to. Adding it is a separate
 * decision with its own PII handling, not a widening of this client.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a two-bucket sweep.</b> {@code answeredType} is required, and the platform's own
 * answered/unanswered classification is authoritative — far better than inferring it from
 * {@code commentDtoList}, whose entries carry no author field and so cannot distinguish a seller's
 * answer from a buyer's follow-up. Each window is therefore swept twice, once per bucket, and the
 * bucket the row arrived in <i>is</i> its status. {@link #ANSWERED_TYPES} is ordered
 * {@code NOANSWER} then {@code ANSWERED} so that an inquiry answered between the two calls is
 * recorded as ANSWERED (last write wins) rather than left falsely open.
 *
 * <p><b>Window.</b> The endpoint caps a query at 7 days, a quarter of the order endpoint's 31, so
 * the initial import is a backward walk of 7-day windows driven by {@link CoupangInquiryCursor}
 * rather than a single sweep.
 *
 * <p><b>A row that cannot be represented truthfully is skipped, not fabricated — and the page
 * still lands.</b> This deliberately differs from {@link CoupangOrdersClient}, which fails the
 * whole page on a missing amount. There, one unreadable line would make the day's <i>aggregate</i>
 * silently wrong, so the page must fail. Here every row is independent, and failing the page would
 * wedge the stream permanently: the same bad row is re-fetched on every retry, so the cursor could
 * never advance past it. So a row missing its identity ({@code inquiryId}), its text
 * ({@code content}), or a parseable {@code inquiryAt} is counted and dropped, with a log line
 * naming the missing FIELD and never its value. Silence would be worse than either.
 *
 * <p><b>Auth.</b> Identical to the order client: per-request CEA HMAC ({@link CoupangSigner}) with
 * {@code X-Requested-By} / {@code X-MARKET}, through the same {@link CoupangLiveCallGuard} choke
 * point. A 429 throws {@link CoupangRateLimitedException} with the cursor unchanged.
