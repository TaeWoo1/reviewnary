/**
 * Deployment-global setup facts a seller needs BEFORE (and during) the guided Coupang connection —
 * available without an account, so the connection surface can display them at the register-calling-IP
 * step.
 *
 * @param advertisedEgressIps the fixed public egress IPv4(s) to register in the Coupang app's calling-IP
 *                            allowlist. Sanitized, non-secret, and EMPTY when none is configured (the UI
 *                            then shows generic guidance, never a fabricated IP). Never null.
 * @param credentialHandoff   the sanitized CREDENTIAL-HANDOFF interlock readiness — a different interlock from
 *                            {@code liveApproval} and deliberately so: that one asks whether SOME approval id is
 *                            armed for a read-only marketplace GET, this one asks whether THIS run, at THIS
 *                            commit, for the credential phase, still has its one unspent handoff. Value-free:
 *                            two id prefixes, a phase literal, two booleans. Never null.
 * @param liveApproval        the sanitized backend live-run readiness — never a credential. Lets a live
 *                            proof's preflight confirm the running backend is armed with the approved run's
 *                            approval id (binding proof), the gap a green health check cannot close. Never
 *                            null.
 * @param orderWireShapeObserved whether the ordersheets wire-shape observation is armed on this backend
 *                            ({@code sellerops.connector.coupang.order-wire-shape}). A boolean, and that is
 *                            all it can be: the observation itself records key names, kinds and counts and
 *                            never a value. It is here because a manifest may only declare capability the
 *                            run can actually execute (approval contract §2) — a gate whose whole purpose is
 *                            «is {@code sellerProductId} on the wire, and how often is it filled» must be
 *                            able to refuse a backend that would not record the answer, rather than spend
 *                            the one approval and find out afterwards.
