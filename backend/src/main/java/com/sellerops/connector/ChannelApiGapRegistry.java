/**
 * What a <b>marketplace</b> does not publish — a fact about the channel itself, true no matter which
 * connector happens to answer for it.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> "쿠팡은 판매자 리뷰 API를 제공하지 않는다" was written down in exactly one
 * place: {@link com.sellerops.connector.coupang.CoupangApiConnector}'s own
 * {@link PullConnector#unsupportedScopes} list. That connector is behind a feature flag that is off
 * by default, so on every default environment {@link ConnectorRegistry} resolves the generic
 * {@link MockApiConnector} instead — which declares no scopes — and the operator screen simply
 * stopped mentioning the missing API. The counterweight to the acquisition axis disappeared with the
 * connector, even though the marketplace fact had not changed.
 *
 * <p><b>What it deliberately is not.</b> It is not derived from {@code supported == false}. That
 * boolean answers "can the resolved pull connector serve this type", and a connector can decline a
 * type for reasons that have nothing to do with an API existing: {@code CoupangApiConnector} serves
 * only {@code ORDER_SUMMARY} and {@code INQUIRY}, so Coupang PRODUCT and SALES read
 * {@code supported=false} while Coupang documents an API for both — its own notes call them
 * "deferred", which is a roadmap fact, not a marketplace one. Reading an absent API out of a false
 * boolean would manufacture three claims about Coupang out of one connector's scope. Each entry here
 * is its own asserted, evidenced fact.
 *
 * <p><b>Nor is it the acquisition axis.</b> {@code AcquisitionPathRegistry} says how SellerOps DOES
 * get a data type; this says what the channel never offered. They are the two halves the operator
 * screen shows side by side — 상품평 수집 경로 확인됨 · Action Window, and 리뷰 API 없음 — and folding
 * either into the other is what produced the contradiction in the first place.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately narrow: an entry appears when someone has looked. NAVER's missing review API was
 * left out on exactly that principle and has since been looked at — Channel Knowledge v1 states it as
 * a LIMITATION a seller and the Agent both read, and a fact asserted there while the code registry
 * stayed silent is the drift this file was built to prevent. It is listed now.
