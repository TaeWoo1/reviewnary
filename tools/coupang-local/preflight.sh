# report (via /api/connect/coupang/setup) that the Coupang connector is enabled AND the live-call interlock
# is armed with THIS run's approval id prefix. That proves the operator's "Seated and ready." will bind to the
# exact backend we prepared — not a stale/other process (docs/sellerops_live_approval_contract.md §2).
